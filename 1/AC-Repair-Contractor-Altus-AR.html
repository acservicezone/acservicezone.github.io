<p>As a lot of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory guarantees remain in location. Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is often hard to measure, as one response stated the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not simply break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the result of repeated usage of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature deterioration, resulting in fractures and holes. , if that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the part.. an extremely useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
