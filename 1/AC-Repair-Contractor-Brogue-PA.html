Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase efficiency even further by performing at lower or greater capability depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning system and refrigerators employed harmful or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could result in fatal mishaps when they dripped.

The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and structure convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
