<h3>Heat Pump Replacement in Chanhassen Minnesota</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>Some health impacts might appear shortly after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures to a pollutant. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such instant impacts are normally short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is just eliminating the individual's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized. Right after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants, signs of some diseases such as asthma may appear, be exacerbated or aggravated.<p>
