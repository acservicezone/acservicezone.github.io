<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside unit as close to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure.
