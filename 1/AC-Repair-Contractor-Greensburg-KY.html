<p>You're encouraging the development of mold in moist air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, preventing mold growth and pollution. Naturally, too-dry air can also irritate your sinuses and lungs, while too much indoor humidity can contribute to the development of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Air toxins can range from impurities generated from the outdoors by your animals to hazardous gas leaks.
