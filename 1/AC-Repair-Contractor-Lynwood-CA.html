<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to provide automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement..

<h3>AC Compressor in Lynwood CA</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
