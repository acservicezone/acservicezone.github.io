<h3>Important Furnace Repair Tips For Your Home in Mountainburg AR</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field.

From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
