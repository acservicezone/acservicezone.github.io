<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, as opposed to commercial or outdoor settings.

<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Muse OK</h3>
<p>Area Ventilation. Outside exhaust fans should be set up in all restrooms and cooking areas. These fans get rid of humidity and carbon monoxide gas. The most reliable fans are long lasting and quiet. Usage fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans equipped with timers or de-humidistat controls are useful to guarantee the fans run for an enough time period. An excellent general rule is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
