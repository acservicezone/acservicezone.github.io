<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance in Pe Ell WA</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
