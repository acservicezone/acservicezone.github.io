<h3>What to Search for When Selecting an Ruthville VA HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his evaluation, guaranteeing I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a referral in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Remove the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
