Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
