<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps at Bensalem PA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat circulation over the whole surface area of a flooring warms the lower half of the space, covering occupants in warmth at a lower total temperature-- in some cases as much as 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a conventional heating system." To put it simply, in-floor heater supply a different mode and level of convenience. And, as different public awareness campaigns have long reminded us, the more comfortable we feel, the more likely we might be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn reducing our energy expenditures.<p>
