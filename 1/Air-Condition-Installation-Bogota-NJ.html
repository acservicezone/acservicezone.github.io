<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies.

However, a number of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
