<p>I have been using them for several years for my services, my own houses and my property customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he assisted me difficulty shoot the issue. He is truthful, reputable, and sensible on rate. It's tough to find a truthful AC man and I'm thankful I found Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>Despite the type of electric radiant flooring heating unit, all are factory-built to remain in one piece and not cut, broken or altered.

Nevertheless, assuming they are installed correctly and properly taken care of, the likelihood of them having issues is small.<p>
