<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or washed as conditions require.

Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
