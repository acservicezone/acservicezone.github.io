<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic.

He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
