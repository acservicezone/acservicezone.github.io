<p>Remember that the SEER ranking is determined using the exact same set of temperatures across the board. The typical summer temperature to reach the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to come to the appropriate SEER score for your location, deduct 2 points for every single 10 degrees over 83.

<p>We take a look at hints before we supply advice to replace instead of repair a heating unit. Among the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are higher every year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be squandering money by not changing the older unit.<p>
