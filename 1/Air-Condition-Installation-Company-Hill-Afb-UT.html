<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
