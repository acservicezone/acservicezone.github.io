Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively straightforward process.
