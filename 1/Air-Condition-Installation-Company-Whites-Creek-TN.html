<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your house via ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably simple process. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
