<p>Normally the most reliable way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to reduce the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-effective approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this area.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
