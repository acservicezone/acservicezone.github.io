<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Secondly like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the system has been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
