<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungi, germs, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must assess and, if required, upgrade the building envelope. For example, he might seal spaces and fractures in the external walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling expenses. Insulation might be a more effective service to your cooling issues than changing your devices.<p>

You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results by means of a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to analyze.<p>
