<h3>Frequent Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Flower Mound TX</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  system instead of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was required and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater since the technicians thought they simply didn't seem best and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
