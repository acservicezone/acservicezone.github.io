<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to order it. My other half said that she had seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent individuals I have satisfied in a very long time. We need to support the real individuals who are there for us if we want to have alternatives to ACME heating.
