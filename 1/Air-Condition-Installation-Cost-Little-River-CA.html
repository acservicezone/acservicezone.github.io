<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be maintained at or below 65%.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
