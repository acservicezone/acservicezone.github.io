<p>A specific air conditioner that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic ac system because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the exact same air path. Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, since all parts of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is actually heated, simply as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power.<p>
