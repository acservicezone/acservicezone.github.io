There can be a serious danger from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Thankfully, there are steps that the majority of people can take both to reduce the threat from existing sources and to prevent new problems from taking place. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Security Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to do something about it that can decrease the level of indoor air pollution in your own house.<p>

The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
