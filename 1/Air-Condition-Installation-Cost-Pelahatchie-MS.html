<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>Leaking Ductwork in Pelahatchie MS</h3>
<p>Last week, Target told press reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the preliminary invasion into its systems was traced back to network credentials that were taken from a 3rd party supplier. Sources now tell KrebsOnSecurity that the vendor in question was a refrigeration, heating and air  conditioning subcontractor that has worked at a variety of places at Target and other top retailers.<p>
<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a big retailer who asked not to be called because he did not have approval to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a team that regularly keeps an eye on energy usage and temperatures in stores to save on expenses (particularly during the night) and to alert store managers if temperatures in the stores vary outside of an appropriate variety that might avoid customers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, however many utilize the guideline that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is most likely a better option. If the current system has not incurred other major repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and problems that resulted in the breakdown can be identified and fixed, repairing the system can make a lot of sense also.<p>
