<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
