<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for the majority of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to supply thermal convenience inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for mindful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities generate mold development and moisture inside is related to a higher occurrence of resident respiratory problems.<p>
