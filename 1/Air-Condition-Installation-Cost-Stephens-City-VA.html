<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are often described as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, periodically linked to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is described as radiant heating.<p>
