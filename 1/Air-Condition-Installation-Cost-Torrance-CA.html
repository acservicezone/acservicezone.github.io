<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have two different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to offer heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the a/c unit into a heatpump While room air conditioning supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is generally more costly than central air.<p>
