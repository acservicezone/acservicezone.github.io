<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite significant.<p>
