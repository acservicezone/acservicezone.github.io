Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. However, a number of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.
