Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils.

It also avoids water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room cooling supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is usually more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great.
