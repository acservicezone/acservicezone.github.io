When you do see your furnace behaving strangely, it is very important that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible.

<p>Benzene is a known human carcinogen. The primary indoor sources of this chemical are environmental tobacco smoke, saved fuels and paint products, and auto emissions in connected garages. Actions that will minimize benzene exposure include getting rid of cigarette smoking within the home, offering optimum ventilation during painting, and discarding paint supplies and unique fuels that will not be used immediately.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a cars and truck radiator or normal family air conditioning unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>
