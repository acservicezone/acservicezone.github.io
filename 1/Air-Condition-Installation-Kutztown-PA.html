<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an uncommonly high bill that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had identified the problem location in examining the bill. He dealt with the issue in one day, had actually adjusted the bill to what I thought about reasonable prior to he recalled, understood what might have caused the issue and had a plan to insure that it would not happen once again. I have thought about All Points a company with stability for the 9 years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>
