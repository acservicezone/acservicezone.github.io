<p>Specialist heating system installations. However, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately fail. HVAC professionals suggest following this fundamental rule when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
<p>Because of our high requirements for job quality and customer service, the majority of our customers pertain to us from recommendations - either individual recommendations from pals, or referrals from builders who rely on Bob's Heating & A/c and advise us to new homeowners.
