<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives requests for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
