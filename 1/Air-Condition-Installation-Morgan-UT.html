<p>We look at ideas before we supply advice to change instead of repair a heating system. Among the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are greater year after year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be losing cash by not changing the older system.<p>
