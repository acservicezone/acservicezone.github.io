<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Because it exhausts warm air out the top, don't position the condenser under a deck or completely confine it. Any airflow limitation will reduce the system's performance. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. Try a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
