<p>When setting up radiant heat, you must give severe thought to the kind of flooring covering in the house. Because it performs and stores heat, ceramic tile works well. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less efficient, but work fairly well.

<p>Ventilation: Lowering pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to water down polluted (indoor) air.
