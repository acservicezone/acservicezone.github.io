<h3>HVAC Installation Near Me in Pickens SC</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system".

When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
