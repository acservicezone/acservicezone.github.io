<h3>Advantages of Professional AC Repair in Rineyville KY</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your financial investment by only utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a licensed agent from a company or seller to do the installation. If you select to try to do it yourself, or employ a non-licensed individual to do the work, in many, if not all cases, you will void the service warranty for the air conditioning system. A voided warranty will not do you any great must the system stop working or malfunction. Do it right from the get-go and hire a certified person with the experience to install the system.<p>
