Stagnant indoor air and heater can increase the quantity of allergy-inducing dust mites, pet dander, and mold spores flowing through your home. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too cold to throw open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you await the warmer weather it is essential to be familiar with a few of the allergic reaction and breathing triggers that may be prowling in your surroundings.<p>
