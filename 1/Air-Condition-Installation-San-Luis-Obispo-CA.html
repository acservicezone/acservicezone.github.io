<h3>Heating Duct in San Luis Obispo California</h3>
<p>If no contaminant sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not enough to account for an increase in the number of employees in the location, stagnant air might also be an issue.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

The radiators might be mounted on walls or set up within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
