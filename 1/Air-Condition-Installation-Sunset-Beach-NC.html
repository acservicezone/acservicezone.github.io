These aspects include bad ventilation (absence of outside air), issues controlling temperature, high or low humidity, recent remodeling, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air coming into the building. In some cases, particular impurities like dust from building and construction or restoration, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (including percentages of chemicals launched as a gas over time) may trigger bad IAQ.<p>
