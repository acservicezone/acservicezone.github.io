<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your investment by only utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a certified representative from a service or merchant to do the installation.

A voided warranty won't do you any great need to the system stop working or malfunction. Do it right from the get-go and work with a certified person with the experience to set up the system.<p>
