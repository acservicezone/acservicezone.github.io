Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the detach block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2).

<p>Terrific service within 24 hours and a reasonable rate. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and really extensive in explaining what services would be carried out. Also Camryn supplied fantastic client service at the end of the appointment by describing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater.
