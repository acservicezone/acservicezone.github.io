Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the ac system will require more energy to cool your home. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>

In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these home appliances (cook stoves, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor contaminants.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The objective is to offer adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
