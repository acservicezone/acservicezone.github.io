<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Hudson IA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
