<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely complex and structure residents may be exposed to a range of pollutants (in the kind of particles and gases) from workplace machines, cleaning items, building and construction carpets, activities and home furnishings, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building products, microbial development (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor pollutants. Other aspects such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how individuals respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside need to be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
