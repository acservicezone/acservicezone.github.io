<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make certain all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the problem.<p>
