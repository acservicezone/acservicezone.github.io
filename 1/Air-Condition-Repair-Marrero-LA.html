<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. Attempt a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
<p>3.
