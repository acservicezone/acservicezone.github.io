By contrast, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can usually be performed in simply a few minutes, often without any tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
