<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller house, which will affect installation expenses. Also a home with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
