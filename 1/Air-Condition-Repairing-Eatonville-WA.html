<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

If the current system has not incurred other significant repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and concerns that caused the breakdown can be recognized and corrected, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense too.<p>
