This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it really rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
