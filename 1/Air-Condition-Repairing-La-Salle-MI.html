They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
