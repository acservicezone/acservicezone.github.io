<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
