<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
