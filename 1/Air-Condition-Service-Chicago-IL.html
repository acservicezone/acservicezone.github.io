<p>Selecting the ideal size air conditioning system is a vital part of the HVAC purchasing procedure and one that you'll need an HVAC professional to help you with.

<p>Outside impurities. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers.
