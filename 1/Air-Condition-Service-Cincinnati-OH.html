The perfect humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater.
