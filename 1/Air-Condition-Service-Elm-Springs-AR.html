<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical material over time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
