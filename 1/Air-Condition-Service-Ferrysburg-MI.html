<p>Award Winning Plumbing and HVAC Services. Lots of common structure products utilized prior to 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Typically, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the structure materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation. Elimination of asbestos-containing materials is not always optimum because the fibers can be spread out into the air throughout the elimination process. A management program for intact asbestos-containing products is frequently suggested instead.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
