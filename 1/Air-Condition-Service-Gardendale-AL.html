<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol result, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which may enter nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outdoor water fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
