<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
