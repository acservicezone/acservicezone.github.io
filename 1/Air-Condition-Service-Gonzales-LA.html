<p>A geothermal heatpump is one of the most energy efficient approaches of heating or cooling a house. Depending on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a home can be warmed in cooler months by condensing and moving energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels found just a few feet listed below ground. In the summer months, the process reverses, thus cooling a home by getting rid of heat. Underground temperature level stays continuous no matter the climate, so geothermal systems provide constant and trustworthy cooling and heating.<p>

In this case, the heat pump is used effectively throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit.

That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down prior to it has a possibility to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In truth, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
