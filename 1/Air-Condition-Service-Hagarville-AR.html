<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation expenses. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other elements that can affect this could be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
