<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. Because approximately 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in efficiency advantage. Since they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Because an unit is set up in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>

<p>The rest of the HVAC system also needs to be in leading condition for the air conditioning system to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which reside inside the house. The technician can examine the ductwork for signs of holes, spaces or extreme dirt if the private parts are in correct order. Sealing leakages in ductwork can improve HVAC effectiveness by as much as 30 percent, and attend to a cooler home in the hot summer season.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood simply what the issue was and fixed it really quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
