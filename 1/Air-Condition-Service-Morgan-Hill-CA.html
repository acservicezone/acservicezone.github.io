<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes unclean and old. The old coolant will negatively affect the system's performance. To make sure the system is working efficiently, consider having a routine coolant system flush. A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
<p>I am really satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years ago and know the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
