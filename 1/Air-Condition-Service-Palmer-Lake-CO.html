<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years earlier and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.

<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit, think about possible effects of indoor air pollution. Follow the producer's instructions, especially instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit properly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is typically an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heater remains in use, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the remainder of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
