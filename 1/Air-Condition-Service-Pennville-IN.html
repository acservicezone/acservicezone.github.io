<p>AC units and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions when they're shut down and then repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>We added a brand-new 1500 sf office to conduct our workshops and required some heating. After getting in touch with Integrity we were provided a great quote on a radiant flooring system. We remained in a time crunch for upcoming event, and Tyler came right out and had us linked in a couple of days. The systems works terrific and the brand-new workplace feels very comfy. It was an enjoyment dealing with such an expert company and would extremely suggest them to anyone searching for HVAC.<p>
