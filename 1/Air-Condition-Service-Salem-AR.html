The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
