Inappropriate change, typically suggested by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue. Consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot light that burns continually if you buy a brand-new gas range or variety. Never use a gas range to heat your house.
