<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a recommendation later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
