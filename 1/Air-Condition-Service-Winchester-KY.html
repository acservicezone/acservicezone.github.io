<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, a number of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item.

<p>Homeowners may also presume that due to the fact that a radiant floor heating system can be viewed (and financed) as a home improvement, its installation will immediately raise their home's worth. No evidence exists suggesting that in-floor heating either favorably or adversely affects home worths. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the yearly Cost vs. Worth Report released by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Improvement Publication. Maybe Real estate agents must think about too many variables to definitively state what a radiant heating system may add to, or deduct from, any provided asking rate. That stated, property buyers aiming to go green," who prioritize energy cost savings, or who definitely desire an in-floor heating system will want to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>
