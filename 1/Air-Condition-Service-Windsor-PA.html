<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outdoor metal cabinet includes the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet consists of the evaporator. In numerous split-system air conditioning system, this indoor cabinet likewise consists of a furnace or the indoor part of a heat pump.

Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
