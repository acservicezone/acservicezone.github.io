<p>Scott Hauncher, a partner at Huron Capital, stated Pueblo looks for more than simply additional income or scale when it makes acquisitions - it tries to find companies that can expand Pueblo's customer base or provide a brand-new line of services. For example, prior to the Niemeyer acquisition, Pueblo carried out limited plumbing work for select customers. With this acquisition, Pueblo broadened its capabilities, allowing an improved value proposal for a broader set of customers.<p>
