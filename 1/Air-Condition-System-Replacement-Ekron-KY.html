<h3>Appropriate Things To Consider In Your Ekron KY Commercial HVAC Service Provider</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater. We chose getting something more pricey than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
