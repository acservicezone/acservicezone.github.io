<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Graff MO</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a referral in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
