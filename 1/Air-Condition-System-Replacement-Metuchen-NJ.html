<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can end up being air-borne, and thus, are easily breathed in. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat allergen might bring on an asthma attack in people with feline allergies, however not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Think about prospective impacts of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system.
