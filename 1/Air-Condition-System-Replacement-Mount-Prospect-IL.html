<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>
<p>The main factor homeowners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the amount of services used.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution.

Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The goal is to supply adequate modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
