<p>Many well and city water does not generally consist of lead. Water typically picks up lead inside the home from household pipes that is made with lead products. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested, the only method to understand. Contact the local health department or the water provider to learn how to get the water tested.

<p>Next, and maybe just as important when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not have the ability to effectively cool the home on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants. Unlike other types of a/c unit, evaporative coolers rely on the outdoors air to be transported through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a home through its air duct system; this cooled outside air should be permitted to press the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to keep and understand.<p>
