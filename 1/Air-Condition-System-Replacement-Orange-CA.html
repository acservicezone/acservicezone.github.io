<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in house building is to reduce air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, roofings, and floorings.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>

No additional charge.<p>
