<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in house building is to reduce air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, roofings, and floorings.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work.

No additional charge.<p>
