(If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI safeguarded.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>They were fantastic! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally requested.
