<p>I usually don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
