<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Iâ $ m really fussy with my stuff. I like my devices and appliances initial, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with inexpensive knock-offs. So buying this a/c to replace my old one was somewhat of a tough fact. You canâ $ t trust the commercial nowadays. Due to the fact that it has actually restored my faith in great manufacturing, am delighted I got this though. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this brand-new Provider I got given that I bought it 7 months back. Itâ $ s just ideal.<p>
<p>Nick B. supplied remarkable, customized, attentive, and quality service. His interaction style is friendly, engaging and reliable. He clearly and completely described all issues and fixes in a manner that made me positive in his capability to solve my repair problems. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally pick up a required part that was not in stock, making sure repairs were made so that my partner and I would not need to withstand another night without heat, during one of the coldest winter seasons in recent memory. He likewise reacted to my call instantly the next morning, and coached me through a short-term fix to an issue that couldn't be solved on the first visit due to unavailable parts. I rely on Nick's skills, experience and capability to provide consistent, quality service.<p>
