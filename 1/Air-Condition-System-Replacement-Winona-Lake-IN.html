<h3>Designing Tips to Central Heating Systems in Winona Lake IN</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various home efficiency upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to help us discuss which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings. We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's product and services was excellent. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while enabling me to carry out the necessary electrical improvements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood just what the problem was and fixed it extremely quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<h3>Residential HVAC in Winona Lake IN</h3>
<p>UW visitors, trainees and employees must have a tidy, healthy environment in which to work, study and perform numerous activities.

<p>Fantastic service within 24 hr and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was really comprehensive and on-time in describing what services would be carried out. Also Camryn offered great customer support at the end of the appointment by discussing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few suggestions of some maintenance jobs we may want to have carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies employed by some in the market.<p>
