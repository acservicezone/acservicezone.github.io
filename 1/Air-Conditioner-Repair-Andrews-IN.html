<p>An undersize unit will not have the ability to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate because it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has a possibility to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>

<p>A/c can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
