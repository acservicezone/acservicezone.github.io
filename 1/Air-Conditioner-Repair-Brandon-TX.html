Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
