Not only was the price fantastic however Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

Depending on the type of system installed, it can be loud and trigger issues if you're extremely adverse dust.

During use, there is a dead time while heat is being carried from the heating unit to the home.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in collecting details on the phone and offering clear directions about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
