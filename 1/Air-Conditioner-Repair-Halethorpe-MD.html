<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in Halethorpe MD</h3>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing procedures.
