<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to offer sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
