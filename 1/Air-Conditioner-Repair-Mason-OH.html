<p>Among the main factors a furnace will run continuously is due to the fact that something is dirty or blocked Prior to trying to fix any issue, require time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan".

<p>I usually do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
