<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
