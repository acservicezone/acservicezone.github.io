<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
