<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
