<p>This is particularly notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from processes or items; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
