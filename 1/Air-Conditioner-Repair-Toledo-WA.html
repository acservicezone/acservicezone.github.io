<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
