<p>I am very amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business several years earlier and understand the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
