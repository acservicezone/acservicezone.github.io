PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have 2 separate units (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This lessens the interior system footprint and enables each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioner into a heat pump While room a/c supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool numerous rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air.<p>
