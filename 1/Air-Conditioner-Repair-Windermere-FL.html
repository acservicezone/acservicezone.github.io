<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
