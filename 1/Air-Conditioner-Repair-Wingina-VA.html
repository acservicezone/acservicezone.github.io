<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
