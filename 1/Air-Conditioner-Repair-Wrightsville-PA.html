<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to minimize the quantity of energy required for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, steps must also be required to minimize contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, residents must look out to the emergence of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization steps must not be undertaken up until these issues have actually been remedied.<p>

<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your home that perfect temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service plan which typically consists of a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products include vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. When they are managed in a way that creates dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be breathed in, these products provide a threat just. When asbestos-containing products are damaged or interrupted by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can become air-borne if proper controls are not in place. This can result in the potential for significant health issue.<p>
