<p>If you're in the very first couple of years of organisation, you might decide to keep your service and product line simple for now.

<p>A geothermal heater is more dependable than alternatives, and is not affected by any external factors, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar energy. For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar power relies on regular sunlight to work efficiently. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a reliable and available source of energy.<p>
