In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged.
