<p>It's not suggested for uncertified individuals to examine & repair cooling & HVAC devices. There is a threat of electric shock & death if not properly trained in emergency ac repair check-ups. It would be best if you left it to an experienced ac repair Houston Midtown tech for proper HVAC diagnosis. Always make certain when examining your cooling equipment to shut off all main power from the emergency breaker panel or disconnect switch.

An unanticipated discharge from an a/c capacitor can cause extreme injury or death.<p>
<p>There is no single test to find an IAQ problem. Your employer needs to inspect measurements of humidity, temperature level and air circulation. In addition, inspection and screening of the ventilation, heating and a/c systems (to make sure it is working according to requirements for constructing usage and occupancy) must be carried out. A building walk-through to check for smells and look for water damage, leakages, dirt or pest droppings might be helpful. Leaks need to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, air conditioning systems, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can become infected with fungi or bacteria and need to be eliminated, likewise. In some scenarios, specific testing for radon or for asbestos may be required as part of structure tenancy. For example, in schools asbestos requires to be inspected every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Action Act-AHERA).<p>
