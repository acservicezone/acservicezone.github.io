The technician will examine all of these aspects of your system and examine the chimney flue and vent stack as well. They will look for signs of corrosion, leakages, and back draft and repair the problem throughout their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do.

Likewise, clean ducts and correct air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however house owners do not have the required equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician check the system periodically.<p>
