<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>In addition, employee health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing may be brought on as the result of temperature extremes, inappropriate humidity levels, and insufficient or too much air circulation.
