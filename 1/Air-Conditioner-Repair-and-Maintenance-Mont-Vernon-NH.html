<p>A/c can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>

<p>The primary health impact connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
