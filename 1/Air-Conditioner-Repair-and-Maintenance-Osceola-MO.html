<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
