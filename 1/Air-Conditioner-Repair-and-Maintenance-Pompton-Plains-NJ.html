<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Convected heat systems have actually been around given that the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and connected them into a hot water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and an elementary pumping machine to distribute hot water that warmed their stone floorings.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
