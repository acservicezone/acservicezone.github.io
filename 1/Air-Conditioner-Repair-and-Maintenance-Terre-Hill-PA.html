<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the flooring surface area.
