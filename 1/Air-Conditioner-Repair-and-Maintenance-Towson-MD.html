A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to appropriately service and the system has actually been running issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
