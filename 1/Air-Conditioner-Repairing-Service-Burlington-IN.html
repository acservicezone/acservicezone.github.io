<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil.
