<p>All homes require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been burnt out from usage.

Furnaces that kick on regularly might be because of a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
