<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. When they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and tied them into a hot water supply, glowing heat systems have actually been around since the days of the Romans. Romans utilized a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and a primary pumping device to distribute warm water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the uniformity of the floor heat moved heat to other short articles in the spaces, including the human residents.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioning system and refrigerators used flammable or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
