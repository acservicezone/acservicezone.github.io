<h3>How to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews in Palmyra VA</h3>
<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while at the same time eliminating waste gases and particulates. Needless to say, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the harder it is for your lungs to remove them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside your home or outdoors - can make it progressively hard for your lungs to function properly, and can have unfavorable health affects.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
