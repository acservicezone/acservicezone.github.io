<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is usually higher than many heatpump options, they can still be extremely efficient, depending upon the design you purchase. Among the main advantages of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to greater temperatures than other heating choices. This means it can heat up your home to the desired temperature quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
