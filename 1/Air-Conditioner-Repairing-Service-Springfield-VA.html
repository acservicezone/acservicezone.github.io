Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down completely.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor unit as close to the house as possible per my demand.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
