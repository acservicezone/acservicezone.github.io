CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

<h3>How To Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Streamwood IL</h3>
<p>When constructing your brand-new home a well-functioning Heating & cooling system is crucial, in addition to the air quality you breathe within. We have the experience and resources necessary to help from the planning stages through to the final installation. We use the most recent software application to assist design your ductwork system and use the highest quality products in the building and installation.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
