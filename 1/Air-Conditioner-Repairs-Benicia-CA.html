<p>There are some ranges of mold which contain harmful substances (mycotoxins).

<p>A number of initiatives imagine to minimize indoor air contamination by limiting VOC emissions from items. There are regulations in France and in Germany, and various voluntary ecolabels and rating systems including low VOC emissions criteria such as EMICODE, 19 M1, 20 Blue Angel 21 and Indoor Air Convenience 22 in Europe, in addition to California Standard CDPH Area 01350 23 and numerous others in the USA.

<h3>HVAC Systems Are Essential for All Homes and Offices in Benicia CA</h3>
