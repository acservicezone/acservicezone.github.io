<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s below package to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>There are a great deal of benefits to using a radiant heating system over a standard forced air heating system.

Required air heater also tend to produce cold and hot areas throughout your house, due to the nature of how warm air increases to the top of a room and sinks as it cools.<p>
