<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
