<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing product bought with the house. This company presented a service agreement contract to provide service to heating, electrical and plumbing. Throughout the examination on a very cold day they killed the furnace claiming health risk factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a new property owner I have learned how to recognize the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
