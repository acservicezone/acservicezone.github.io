<h3>The Way to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Forest Park GA</h3>
<p>The icing problem ends up being much more serious with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly set up in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as an electrical heater, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
