<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
