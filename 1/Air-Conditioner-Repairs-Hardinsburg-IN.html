<h3>Clogged Air Filters in Hardinsburg IN</h3>
<p>House heating systems are complicated systems that need the services of a contractor to set up. While you can certainly purchase your furnace yourself, many contractors won't warranty the furnace or may not install it if you don't buy it from them. Installation charges vary across the county, but start at approximately $50 per hour up to $150 or more. It takes approximately five hours to install a little furnace and more to set up a big one.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S).

Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
