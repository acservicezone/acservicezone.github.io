<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Necessary Service in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% performance or better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which may be ranked as low as 80% effectiveness, this can suggest significant savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase efficiency even further by performing at lower or greater capability depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. Therefore, a professional service individual need to be required nearly any maintenance other than regular cleaning.

While there aren't lots of repairs you can make yourself, there are specific maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system running at peak performance.<p>
