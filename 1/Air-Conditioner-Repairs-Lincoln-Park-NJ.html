<p>Information offered in this security guide is based on existing clinical and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. The requirements do not need you to alter your existing central air conditioning units, and replacement parts and services need to still be readily available for your house's systems. The "lifespan" of a central air conditioning conditioner is about 15 to twenty years. Makers generally continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts readily available and honoring maintenance contracts after the new standard goes into effect.<p>
<p>More typical in reasonably older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes electrical power, gas or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in private rooms. All-electric boilers can accomplish as much as 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. More recent gas boilers should achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>Similar to many home enhancement projects, the cost of a complete central heater can vary extensively based upon the size of the house. The majority of furnaces will last in between 15 and 20 years. In selecting a furnace, homeowner should consider heat output and performance. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace should be matched to the size of the house. A small home, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too quickly and turn off for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
