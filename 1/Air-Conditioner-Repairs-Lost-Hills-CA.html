<h3>HVAC Installation in Lost Hills CA</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my services, my own houses and my property customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he encouraged me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again, he assisted me difficulty shoot the problem.

<p>Next, and possibly simply as important when it comes to central air costs, is the AC system's size.

On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to effectively cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
