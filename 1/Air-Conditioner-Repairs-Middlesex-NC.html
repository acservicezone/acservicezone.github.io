<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>PE companies tend to run with the goal of selling or spinning off a firm eventually. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a big service in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management. Ares purchased CoolSys from Audex, another PE company, earlier this year. Audex had actually owned CoolSys for 3 years before that.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
