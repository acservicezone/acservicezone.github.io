<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Ensure all the registers in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
