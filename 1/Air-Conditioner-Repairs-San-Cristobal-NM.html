<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in San Cristobal NM - The Benefits</h3>
<p>All modern cooling systems, even little window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will require to have the filters changed more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
