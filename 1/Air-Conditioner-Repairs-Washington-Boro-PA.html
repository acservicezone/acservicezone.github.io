<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
