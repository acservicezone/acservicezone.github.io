<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from items or processes; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>As mentioned above, activating your new under tile floor heating system prematurely, before the mortar has treated, can cause the grout to split or to not adhere correctly, and might void the warranty of your mortar product.
