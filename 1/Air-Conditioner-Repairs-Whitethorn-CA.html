<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, class or laboratory environments, instead of industrial or outside settings. In jobs where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It might also include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private areas.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic however Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
