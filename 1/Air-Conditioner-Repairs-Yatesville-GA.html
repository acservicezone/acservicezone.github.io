<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and offices matters, particularly given that we spend the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in very damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning system is large, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning system will need more energy to cool your home. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>If you wish to save yourself money and time over the long term, having annual maintenance performed on the furnace is a great idea.
