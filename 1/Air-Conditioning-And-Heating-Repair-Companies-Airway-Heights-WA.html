<p>The quality of the air inside our homes, schools and offices matters, especially given that we invest the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in exceptionally damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is oversized, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c will need more energy to cool your home. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>We're devoted to helping you enjoy the greatest returns from your air conditioning unit and heat investment. Register for a maintenance contract so that you never forget a tune-up.

<p>A geothermal heat pump is one of the most energy effective methods of heating or cooling a home. Depending on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a home can be heated in cooler months by moving and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures found just a couple of feet listed below ground. In the summertime, the process reverses, consequently cooling a house by removing heat. Underground temperature remains constant no matter the environment, so geothermal systems provide reputable and consistent heating & cooling.<p>
<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
