<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>Clean and mop floorings window ledges and chewable surfaces such as baby cribs with a solution of powdered automatic dishwashing machine detergent in warm water. (Dishwashing machine detergents are recommended since of their high content of phosphate.) Most multi-purpose cleaners will not remove lead in common dust. Wash toys and stuffed animals routinely. Ensure that kids clean their hands before meals, nap time, and bedtime.<p>
