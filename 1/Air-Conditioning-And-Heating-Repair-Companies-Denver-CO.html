The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, however it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
