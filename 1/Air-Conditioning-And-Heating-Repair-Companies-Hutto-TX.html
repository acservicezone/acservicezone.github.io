Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
