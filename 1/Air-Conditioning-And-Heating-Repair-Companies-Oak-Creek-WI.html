<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the conventional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
