<p>Old lead-based paint is the most substantial source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful direct exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is poorly gotten rid of from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of air-borne lead particles in homes can also result from lead dust from outside sources, including polluted soil tracked inside, and use of lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>If your a/c is old, think about purchasing an energy-efficient design.
