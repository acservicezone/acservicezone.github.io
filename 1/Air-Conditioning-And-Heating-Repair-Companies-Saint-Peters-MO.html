<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut off completely.<p>

<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was kind of odd being that package was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we dealt with concerns. I would recommend this product to anyone who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
