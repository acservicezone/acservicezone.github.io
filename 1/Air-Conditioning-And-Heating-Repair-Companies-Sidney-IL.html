<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, considering that it is protected inside. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>
