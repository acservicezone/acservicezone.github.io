<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same contaminants. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
