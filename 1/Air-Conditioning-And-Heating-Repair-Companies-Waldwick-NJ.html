<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a reference later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
