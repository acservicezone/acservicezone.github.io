<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything.

<h3>Ductwork Repair and Replacement in Acworth GA</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
