Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine elements. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, visit Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
