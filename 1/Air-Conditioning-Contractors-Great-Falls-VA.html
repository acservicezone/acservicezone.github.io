<p>To determine the appropriate size of oil furnace you require for your house, calculate the house's square video footage and determine what zone your house remains in.

Multiply the length and width of each space in your home that you heat and add up all the spaces together to get your overall square video.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. A good location to begin is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there haven't bothered with it!
