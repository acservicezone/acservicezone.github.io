<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Long Lane MO</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Oil furnaces tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which needs to be correctly vented and cleaned up from the furnace frequently. Change the filters regularly and have your ductwork cleaned up since the soot develops inside the ducts, reducing their performance gradually. Anticipate to service your furnace annual at a cost of around $200, change your filters every 1 - 3 months, and clean your ducts every 3 - 4 years to keep your system running efficiently.<p>
