<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
