<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
