<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " primary ecological danger to the health of kids in the United States." There are numerous methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead gets in the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Prior to it was understood how harmful lead might be, it was used in paint, fuel, water pipes, and many other items.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly just as crucial when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to correctly cool the home on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>
