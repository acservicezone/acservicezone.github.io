There have been awkward sounds. I got it examined and repaired. I am hoping that is completion of the issue. Overall, it has actually been a good experience. Trustworthy on the whole.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend utilized in cars in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.
