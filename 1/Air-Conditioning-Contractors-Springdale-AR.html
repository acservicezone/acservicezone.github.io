<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation procedure. However, many of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be extreme. They include hold-ups in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, kids, and babies are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults given that lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the damaging impacts of lead. Children may have greater direct exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
