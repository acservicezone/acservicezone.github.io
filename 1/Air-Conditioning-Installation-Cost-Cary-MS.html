Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). The lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
