It safeguards the environment from damaging digging, fracking, or toxins due to the fact that the energy used to heat your home is drawn out straight from the ground.

While geothermal systems do use some electrical energy, they release far fewer greenhouse gases or other pollutants than heating systems that require natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
