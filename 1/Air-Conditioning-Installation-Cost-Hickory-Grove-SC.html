<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. Often it's not a major problem, and your system may merely require some maintenance work. It is surprising how many of us practice preventive maintenance on our cars and trucks, for instance, but don't do the exact same thing for the system that keeps us warm in the winter. Do not hesitate to ask about our service plans that consist of preventive maintenance if you want to remain ahead of any issues with your house or company HVAC system, so you can prevent pricey repairs or replacements.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heat pump, whatever needs to be replaced eventually. As equipment ages, it becomes less efficient. Central air conditioning systems and heat pumps usually last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last up to 20 years. If your system is near, or past, its anticipated life-span, replacement may be the most cost-efficient service.<p>

<h3>Locating Best HVAC Contractors in Hickory Grove SC</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in home building is to reduce air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, floors, and roofs. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas that hinders the shipment of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can trigger unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can trigger a series of symptoms from headaches, d izziness, weakness, disorientation, confusion, and nausea, to fatigue in healthy individuals and episodes of increased chest pain in individuals with persistent heart problem. The signs of carbon monoxide gas poisoning are often puzzled with the influenza or gastrointestinal disorder. Fetuses, infants, elderly people, and individuals with anemia or with a history of heart or breathing disease can be specifically sensitive to carbon monoxide direct exposures.<p>

<p>In homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pressed wood items made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products made for indoor usage consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); wood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiber board contains a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pushed wood item and is typically acknowledged as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood item.<p>
