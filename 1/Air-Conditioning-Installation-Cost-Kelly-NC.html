<p>AC units and thermostats have integrated hold-up features when they're closed down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon a number of factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important impacts. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends on individual sensitivity, which differs significantly from person to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological toxins after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical contaminants as well.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release contaminants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
