<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Port Charlotte FL?</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>Air toxins can vary from contaminants brought in from the outdoors by your animals to hazardous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air toxin arising from natural gas that escapes into your house without being burned off. Older houses might include asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In restrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can become a problem where wetness levels are typically greater than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
