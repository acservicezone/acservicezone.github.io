<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floorings and connected them into a warm water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and an elementary pumping machine to distribute warm water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the harmony of the floor heat transferred heat to other posts in the rooms, including the human occupants.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, in addition to all other kinds of heat pumps, have performances rated according to their coefficient of efficiency, or POLICE OFFICER.
