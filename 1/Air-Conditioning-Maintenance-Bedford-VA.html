<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. However, much of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product.
