Furnaces that kick on regularly might be because of a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively.

While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not use automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.
