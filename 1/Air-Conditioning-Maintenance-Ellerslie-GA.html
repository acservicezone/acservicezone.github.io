<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
