(If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
