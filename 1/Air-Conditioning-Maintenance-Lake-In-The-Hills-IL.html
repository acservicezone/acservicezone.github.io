<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Depending on where in the US your home is located, the local region's environment can alter considerably.
