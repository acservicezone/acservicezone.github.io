That's since it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to provide a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up just a few years ago.<p>
