<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts decades, given that it is secured inside. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever.

<p>A third way to choose whether your home may have bad indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product with time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
