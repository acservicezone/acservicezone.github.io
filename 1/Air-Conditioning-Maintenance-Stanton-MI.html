<p>The purpose of most building ventilation systems is to generate sufficient fresh air for occupant comfort while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing safety at affordable energy costs.

Move to another contractor if your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square video alone. Similar to determining the size of a system required based on BTUs, figuring out the appropriate size of unit for your home also depends upon the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
