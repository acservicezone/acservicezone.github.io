<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was type of unusual being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and takes time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window.

<p>Outside contaminants. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a home. Particulates and irritants discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Specialists advise using filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller particles and usually are better for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
