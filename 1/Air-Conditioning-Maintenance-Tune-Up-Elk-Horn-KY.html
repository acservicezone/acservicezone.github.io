<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace professionals frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned regularly, they can end up being obstructed with debris that can restrict airflow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Filthy filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases trigger the system to close down completely. By comparison, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can generally be carried out in just a few minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work.

No extra charge.<p>
