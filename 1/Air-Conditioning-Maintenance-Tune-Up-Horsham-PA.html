<p>Indoor air contamination is triggered by burning solid fuel sources - such as firewood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The task of an HVAC technician is relatively complex and can vary substantially from one office or home to the next. Every maintenance task and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance job might need totally different actions and processes than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being examined. Installations can also differ substantially, depending on the age of the structure and how well the existing system was installed. Sometimes, entirely new ductwork might need to be set up in a structure that had none prior to.<p>

<p>Energy effectiveness can be enhanced a lot more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating unit. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the circulation of air.
