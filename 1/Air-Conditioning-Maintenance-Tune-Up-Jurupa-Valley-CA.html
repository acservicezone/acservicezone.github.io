The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to use. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets.
