<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>The capability of natural chemicals to trigger health results differs considerably, from those that are highly poisonous, to those without any known health impact.

At present, very little is understood about what health effects happen from the levels of organics typically found in homes. Numerous organic compounds are known to cause cancer in animals; some are presumed of triggering, or are understood to trigger, cancer in human beings.<p>
