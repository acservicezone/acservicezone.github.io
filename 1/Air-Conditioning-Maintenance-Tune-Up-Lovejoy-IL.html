After two years, things started to change. There have been awkward sounds. I got it fixed and inspected. I am hoping that is completion of the problem. In general, it has been an excellent experience. Dependable on the whole. Cool operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its appearances in the beginning. But then realized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>When every year to make sure all the systems are working well, you must get your HVAC system aesthetically examined at least. This examination is a crucial element of HVAC maintenance. You will not see an issue till it stops working in the middle of winter if you do not get your system examined.

Routine assessment and maintenance likewise helps keep it in good shape and lengthens its life.<p>
