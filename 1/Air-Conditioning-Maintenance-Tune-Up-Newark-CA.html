<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building And Construction and Commissioning is created for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other professionals interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of structure products, smoking cigarettes, home items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas ranges or kerosene space heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a number of purposes in manufactured products. For example, it is used to include permanent-press qualities to clothing and drapes, as a component of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finish products.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system elements, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
