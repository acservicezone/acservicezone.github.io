<p>One of the disadvantages of central heating is that it's possibly expensive to install, specifically in an older house. Depending upon the kind of system set up, it can be loud and cause problems if you're extremely allergic to dust.

During use, there is a time delay while heat is being carried from the heating unit to the home.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year.

Manufacturers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they detected the concern and fixed very rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
