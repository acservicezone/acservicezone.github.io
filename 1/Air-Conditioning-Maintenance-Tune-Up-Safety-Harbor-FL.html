<p>It might feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, however for individuals who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have breathing problems, winter season can intensify problems. Stagnant indoor air and heater can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, family pet dander, and mold spores flowing through your home. In late winter season and early spring, it may still be too cold to throw open the windows to take out the musty air, so while you await the warmer weather condition it is necessary to be aware of some of the allergic reaction and breathing triggers that might be hiding in your environments.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release contaminants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have a negative influence on occupants-- outdoors air needs to be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
