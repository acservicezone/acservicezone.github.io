<h3>HVAC Maintenance Near Me in San Martin California</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>In a location where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good main heating systems.
