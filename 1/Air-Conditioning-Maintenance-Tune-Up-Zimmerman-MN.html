<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me concerning an unusually high bill that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he knew that I had called the service manager and left a message of concern.

<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is generally greater than many heat pump alternatives, they can still be highly efficient, depending upon the model you acquire.

This means it can heat up your home to the wanted temperature level quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
