<p>The compressor can overheat and shut down if the condenser coils are blocked. You'll experience periodic periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them again. Turn off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the detach block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the air conditioning service still does not work appropriately after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work completely unless you do this.<p>
