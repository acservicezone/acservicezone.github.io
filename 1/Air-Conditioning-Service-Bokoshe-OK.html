<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden flooring joist system, underneath the wooded subsurface and final flooring surface. This is normally used in a second or third-floor  location and benefits from the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
