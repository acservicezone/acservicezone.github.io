The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
