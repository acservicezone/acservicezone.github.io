<p>SysTech Style specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
