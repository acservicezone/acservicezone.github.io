<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

Houston Montrose 77006 77098 homes with only one a/c filter need replacing regularly.<p>
