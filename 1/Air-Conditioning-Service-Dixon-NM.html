<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material over time.
