<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
