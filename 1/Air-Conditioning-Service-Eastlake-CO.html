Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
