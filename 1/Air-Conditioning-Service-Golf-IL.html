<p>My eldest son constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think of anything else other than changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is itâ and low $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
