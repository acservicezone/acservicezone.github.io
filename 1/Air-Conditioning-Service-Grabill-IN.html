Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>

The majority of people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to raised concentrations on the task; some industrialized illness from direct exposure to clothes and equipment brought home from task websites.<p>
