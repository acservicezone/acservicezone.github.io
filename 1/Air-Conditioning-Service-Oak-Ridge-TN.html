<p>The function of many structure ventilation systems is to bring in adequate fresh air for occupant convenience while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building security at affordable energy costs. Load calculating is referred to as the Handbook J calculation and should be carried out by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or system cost for a/c. If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square footage alone, relocate to another contractor.
