<p>If no contaminant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stagnant air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of co2 and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. When ventilation is not adequate to account for a boost in the number of workers in the area, stagnant air may likewise be an issue.<p>
<p>Benzene is a recognized human carcinogen. The primary indoor sources of this chemical are ecological tobacco smoke, stored fuels and paint products, and car emissions in connected garages. Actions that will reduce benzene exposure include removing cigarette smoking within the home, providing for optimum ventilation during painting, and disposing of paint products and special fuels that will not be used instantly.<p>
<p>A customized air conditioning system that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic ac system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the very same air path. Since its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, considering that all elements of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
