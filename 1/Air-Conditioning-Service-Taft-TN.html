The best thing to do is making certain that the heating system burners are examined and cleaned thoroughly before colder seasons start.

By contrast, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can normally be performed in just a few minutes, often with no tools required.

<p>Old lead-based paint is the most substantial source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is poorly eliminated from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.
