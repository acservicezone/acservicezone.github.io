<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Contractor in Dunkirk</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold might be living in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current survey by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system elements, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
