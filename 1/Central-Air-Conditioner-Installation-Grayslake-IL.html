<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>If your single phase a/c unit isn't old adequate to justify replacement, think about an entire home dehumidifier. By setting up dehumidification devices inside an existing single phase system, you can take pleasure in some of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without replacing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, enhancing indoor air quality and allowing greater comfort at greater temperatures.<p>
