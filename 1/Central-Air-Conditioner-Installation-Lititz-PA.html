<p>All houses need efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been stressed out from usage. Another possible factor might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the appropriate temperature. Heating systems that kick on often might be due to a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>

<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
