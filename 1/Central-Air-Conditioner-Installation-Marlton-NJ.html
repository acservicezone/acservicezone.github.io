<p>If you require furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else might come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to order it. My partner stated that she had actually seen an excellent evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good people I have met in a long time. We need to support the genuine people who are there for us if we want to have options to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
