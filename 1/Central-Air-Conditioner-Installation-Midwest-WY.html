<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All houses need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the proper temperature level. Furnaces that kick on frequently might be because of an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
