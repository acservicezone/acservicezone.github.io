<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning sensations in the eyes and throat, nausea, and difficulty in breathing in some human beings exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million).

<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, because it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical guidelines eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>

<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, but it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and building tenancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have an unfavorable influence on occupants-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
