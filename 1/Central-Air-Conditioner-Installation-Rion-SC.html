The unit runs quietly and effectively, however to have two significant parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
