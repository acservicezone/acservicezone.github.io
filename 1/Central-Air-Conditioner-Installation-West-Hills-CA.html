<h3>Indoor Air Conditioner in West Hills CA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
