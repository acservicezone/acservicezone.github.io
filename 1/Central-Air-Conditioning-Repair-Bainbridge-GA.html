<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the system has been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
