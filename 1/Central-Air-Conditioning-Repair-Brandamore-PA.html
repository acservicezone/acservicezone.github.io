<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Make certain all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
