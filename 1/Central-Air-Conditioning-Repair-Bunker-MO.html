<p>IAQ can be affected by gases (consisting of carbon monoxide gas, radon, volatile organic compounds ), particulates, microbial contaminants (mold, germs ), or any mass or energy stress factor that can induce adverse health conditions.

<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx clients do not understand why their HVAC system is not working when they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. The copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's more than likely your issue. The next action is to defrost your air conditioning equipment if you discovered that your conditioning filter requires changing. The most convenient method to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
