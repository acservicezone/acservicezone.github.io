<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you need to inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
