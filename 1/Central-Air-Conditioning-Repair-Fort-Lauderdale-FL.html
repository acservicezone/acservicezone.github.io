The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine parts. To avoid this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, visit Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
