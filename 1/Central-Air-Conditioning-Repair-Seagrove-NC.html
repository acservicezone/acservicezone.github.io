<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
