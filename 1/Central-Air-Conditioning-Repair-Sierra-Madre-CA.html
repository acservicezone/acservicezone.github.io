<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many furnaces have multiple control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heating systems, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel should be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t appropriately identified, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable as soon as installed. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time fixing the problem, all the while discussing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
