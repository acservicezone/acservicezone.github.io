<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
