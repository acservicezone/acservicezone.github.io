<p>There are a great deal of advantages to using a radiant heat system over a traditional forced air heating system.

A building walk-through to look for smells and try to find water damage, leakages, dirt or pest droppings might be handy. Leakages need to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c units, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can become contaminated with fungi or germs and require to be removed, likewise. In some situations, particular testing for radon or for asbestos might be needed as part of structure tenancy. For example, in schools asbestos needs to be inspected every 3 years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Danger Emergency Action Act-AHERA).<p>
