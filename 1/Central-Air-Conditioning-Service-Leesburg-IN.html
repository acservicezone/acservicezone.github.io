<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in delay features when they're closed down and then repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Often, indoor air quality problems in big commercial buildings can not be successfully identified or fixed without an extensive building investigation.
