<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced.
