<h3>Factors to Consider When Looking for a Good AC Repair Company in Mount Judea AR</h3>
<p>Biological impurities: the biological pollutants can include germs, infections, fungi (mold), dust mite irritant, animal dander, insect bio detritus, fiberglass and fibers, pollen, cockroach irritant, etc. and may arise from inadequate maintenance and house cleaning, water spills, insufficient humidity control, condensation, or may be brought into the building by residents, infiltration, or ventilation air.

<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
