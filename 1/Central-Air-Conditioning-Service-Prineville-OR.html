<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, check out Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
