<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years earlier and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to supply sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A common component essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
