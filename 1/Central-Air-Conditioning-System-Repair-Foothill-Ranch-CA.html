<h3>Types of HVAC Repairs in Foothill Ranch CA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they required to remove the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We picked getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenditures. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though most air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems might be belt-driven. Squealing sounds from a belt-drive air handler normally take place when the belt that links the motor to the blower slips. For the most part, the belt is poorly aligned or worn and needs replacement. Follow the instructions above under A/c Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's manual.<p>
