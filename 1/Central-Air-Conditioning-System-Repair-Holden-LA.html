<h3>Ductwork Installation in Holden Louisiana</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the visit. They advised changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was really pleased they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it might flatter two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's since it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to supply a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed just a few years earlier.<p>
<p>We have been extremely happy with Integrity's devices (Trane dealer) and service (today Braxten completed yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heatpump has actually worked effectively and is so efficient that it considerably lowered our energy costs - the system will spend for itself in less than 5 years. The couple of times we require them for emergency situations they reacted rapidly and solved the issue.<p>
