<h3>Electric Heating in Holder FL</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
