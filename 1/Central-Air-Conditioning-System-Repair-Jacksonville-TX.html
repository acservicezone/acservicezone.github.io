<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
