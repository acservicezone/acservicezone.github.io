<h3>Central Air Conditioner Installation in Maricopa CA</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
