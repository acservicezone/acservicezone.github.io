The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air.

Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might also be necessary.<p>
