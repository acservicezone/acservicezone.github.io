<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as developed. Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperature levels (style levels), instead of the greater temperature levels often utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to offer thermal comfort indoors. However, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for mindful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities generate mold development and moisture inside is related to a higher frequency of occupant respiratory issues.<p>
