<p>In a location where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heating unit. You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperatures reach freezing. Your heating technician can install controls which instantly shut down the heatpump if temperatures drop and reach listed below freezing. The controls will require the furnace to come on, effectively heating the house in these conditions.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a routine oil modification in your vehicle.

Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
