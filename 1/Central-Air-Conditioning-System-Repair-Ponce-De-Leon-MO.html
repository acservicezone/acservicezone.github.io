<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am very satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company many years back and understand the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
