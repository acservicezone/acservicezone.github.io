<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
