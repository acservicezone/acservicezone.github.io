<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as important when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to effectively cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
