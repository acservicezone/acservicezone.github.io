<h3>Leaking Ductwork in Melba ID</h3>
<p>Measurement procedures are being established and shown to evaluate building ventilation and indoor toxin concentrations. These procedures vary from advanced tracer gas approaches used primarily in building research efforts to less involved procedures that can be used by building operators. NIST researchers are continually establishing new test treatments, and then showing them in the field to evaluate their expediency and reliability. The efforts in which these treatments are shown in the field has actually led to the development of an important database of structure ventilation and indoor air quality performance.<p>
<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, because it is secured indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
