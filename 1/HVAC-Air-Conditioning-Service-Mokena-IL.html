<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a routine oil change in your automobile. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter better traps impurities and particles in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. During high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
