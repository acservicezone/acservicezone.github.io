<p>At present, EPA does not suggest using air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay items. The effectiveness of these devices is uncertain due to the fact that they just partially remove the radon decay items and do not diminish the quantity of radon getting in the home. EPA prepares to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or might become, a reliable ways of reducing the health risk from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers additional details on air-cleaning gadgets to minimize indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at danger. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of symptoms in hundreds of countless asthmatic children, and might cause countless nonasth-matic children to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to secondhand smoke triggers eye, throat, and nose inflammation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually linked direct exposure to pre-owned smoke with the start of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>

Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually.
