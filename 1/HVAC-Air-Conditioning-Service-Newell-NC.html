These investigations revealed that proper ventilation is very important in keeping excellent indoor air quality.<p>

The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year.

Like lots of intricate situations, there's probably more than one right response.
