<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts decades, because it is secured inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to set up.
