<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
