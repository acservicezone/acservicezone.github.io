<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside.

According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same pollutants. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Apartment or condos can have the same indoor air problems as single-family homes since a number of the pollution sources, such as the interior structure products, home furnishings, and household products, are similar.
