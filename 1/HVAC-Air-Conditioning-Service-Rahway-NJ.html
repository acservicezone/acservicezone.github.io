<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're most likely hearing the fan motor trying to start without the boost it requires from the capacitor. You can often conclude that the capacitor has actually stopped working. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the opportunities are excellent that this may work for one cycle, however the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>
<p>There is an essential balance in making your decision though as systems with greater AFUE rankings frequently come with higher cost.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
