There have actually been awkward sounds. I got it fixed and checked. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. In general, it has actually been a good experience. Reputable on the whole. Neat operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its appearances in the beginning. However then realized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>I have actually become fairly proficient at researching items on line prior to purchasing them. However I do not find that there is a central place for searching information about the "real" value of home HVAC systems or perhaps I ought to state a truthful evaluation of these items. Since they are really taxed in the summertime, given that I live in FL it is important to have a good AC unit in your house.<p>
