<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of individuals who reside in the home. Pollutants might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon getting in your home from the ground below. An air contaminant might likewise come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, unstable organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care products. Bacteria and viruses, pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
