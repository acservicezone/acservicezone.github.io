<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.. Secondly like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the unit has been operating issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
