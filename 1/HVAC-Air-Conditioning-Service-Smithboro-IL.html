<p>The possibility of immediate reactions to indoor air contaminants depends on several factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important impacts. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends on specific sensitivity, which differs tremendously from person to individual. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can become sensitized to chemical contaminants also.<p>
<p>I am really impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years back and know the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise impressed that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
