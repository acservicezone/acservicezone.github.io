<h3>AC Replacement Service in Dunkerton IA</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most inexpensive. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
