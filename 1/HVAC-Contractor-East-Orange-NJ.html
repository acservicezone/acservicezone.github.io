<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
