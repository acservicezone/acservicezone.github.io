<p>Are you including a brand-new room onto your home? Perhaps you have a room with unique heating and cooling challenges, such as rooms that always seem to be too cold or too hot.

There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out repairing the issue, all the while discussing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
