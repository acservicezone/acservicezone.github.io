<p>Truth: Federal and local rewards typically total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can frequently make the preliminary price of a system competitive with conventional equipment.

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton.
