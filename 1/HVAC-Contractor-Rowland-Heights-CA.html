<p>Simplify your services, make more services income, and offer a remarkable client experience. To make sure the system you choose is the best size for your home, the Sears HVAC professional does an electronic load computation price quote to identify the exact type of heat and cooling system that's ideal for your home-we don't just change it with the same size system you currently have. These computations take into consideration things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This action is important so the unit isn't too little or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
