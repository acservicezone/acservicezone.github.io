<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

And if it's too small, you won't get enough cool or warm air to keep you comfortable.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as important as a regular oil change in your automobile.

Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter better traps impurities and particles in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. During high usage months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>
