<h3>Forced Air Furnace in San Carlos California</h3>
<p>Some HVAC technicians sell service agreements to their customers, offering regular maintenance of heating and cooling systems. In some circumstances, other tradespeople will work with HVAC techs to help repair or set up cooling and heating systems.

<p>Energy performance can be enhanced a lot more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating unit. Zones are managed by several thermostats. In water heating unit the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the flow of air. In this case, the control system is extremely important to preserving a correct temperature level.<p>
<p>Air conditioning unit can develop a great deal of water due to the fact that they get rid of wetness from the air.

In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate problems, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>
