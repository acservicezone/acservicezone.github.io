<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to offer adequate modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common element needed in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
