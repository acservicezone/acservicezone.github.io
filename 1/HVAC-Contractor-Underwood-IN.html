Inadequate ventilation likewise happens if the air supply and return vents within each space are obstructed or placed in such a way that outside air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building residents. Incorrectly located outside air intake vents can likewise bring in air contaminated with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms.
