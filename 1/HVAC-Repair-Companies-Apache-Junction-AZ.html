<p>When central air service stops working throughout a heat spell, you might need to wait days for an HVAC repair technician or an ac contractor to show up, and you'll most likely pay at least a number of hundred for the repair. But if you're comfortable working around electrical energy and are willing to invest about $50 on parts, you can most likely repair your cooling service yourself in about two hours and conserve about $225 on parts markup and labor.<p>
<p>Energy effectiveness can be improved even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating systems. Zones are managed by several thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is extremely critical to preserving a proper temperature.<p>
