Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface area units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming typical functions of eco-friendly homes as part of the growing green structure motion. Green jobs accounted for 20 percent of all newly built houses in the U.S. in 2015.
