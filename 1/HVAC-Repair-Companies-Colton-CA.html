<p>Structures are created or intended to respond actively to some of these modifications in and around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sanitize, and keep surfaces to boost their appearance, durability, or performance. In other cases, such modifications discreetly or perhaps dramatically alter structures in manner ins which may be important to their own integrity or their effect on structure occupants through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We may find it useful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, specifically, some of the methods used by scientists studying communities, in order to get a boosted understanding of the environments in which we spend most of our time, our buildings.<p>
