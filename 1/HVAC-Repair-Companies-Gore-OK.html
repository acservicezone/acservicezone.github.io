Insulation may be a more effective option to your cooling issues than replacing your equipment.<p>

<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
