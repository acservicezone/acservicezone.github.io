<p>The purpose of the majority of building ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for occupant convenience while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building safety at affordable energy costs. Load computing is referred to as the Handbook J calculation and must be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or unit cost for cooling.
