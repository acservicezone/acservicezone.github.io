<p>The purpose of the majority of building ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for occupant convenience while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and building safety at affordable energy costs. Load computing is referred to as the Handbook J calculation and must be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or unit cost for cooling. If your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you need based upon experience or on square video alone, transfer to another contractor.

<p>Occupational direct exposure limits use dose-response data which show the health results of repeated direct exposure to one specific chemical.

Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes.
