<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of impurities that have the possible to negatively impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and very little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if essential, update the structure envelope. For instance, he might seal gaps and fractures in the outer walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation might be a more reliable option to your cooling problems than changing your equipment.<p>
<p>Both the condenser and the evaporator are sealed. For that reason, a professional service person ought to be required practically any maintenance besides regular cleaning.
