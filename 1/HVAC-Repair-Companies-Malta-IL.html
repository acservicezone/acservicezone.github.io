<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area.

Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
