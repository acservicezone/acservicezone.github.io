<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>

There are several techniques for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>
