<p>When they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, a lot of Midtown Houston Tx customers don't know why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's probably your issue. The next action is to defrost your air conditioning devices if you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
