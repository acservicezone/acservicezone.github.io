The job of an HVAC technician is relatively complicated and can differ significantly from one office or home to the next. Every maintenance task and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance job might need totally various steps and processes than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being checked. Setups can also differ considerably, depending on the age of the structure and how well the existing system was set up.
