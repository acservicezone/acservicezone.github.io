<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 ought to be adjusted often, and outdoor measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from products or processes; for the a lot of part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems.

Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
