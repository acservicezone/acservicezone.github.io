<p>Indoor contaminants. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops should be utilized with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating devices must be sealed and power-vented systems installed to get rid of items of incomplete combustion.
