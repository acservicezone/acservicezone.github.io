<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money can be found in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract..
