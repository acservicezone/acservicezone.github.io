Or if the outdoor air consumption is located near a source of moisture or other outside toxin, it might function as a path to carry the impurities inside.

<p>A lot of HVAC companies will evaluate things like specialized filter changes throughout Preventative Maintenance visits, individually, as an add on service for you. No two systems are exactly the very same, however filter modifications are something we provide throughout PM visits if the customer needs it- particularly the unattainable filters- because we know how crucial it is that they be changed out & how tough it can be for a home owner to do it.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a routine oil change in your car. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter as soon as every three months. Throughout high use months, check the filters at least monthly.<p>
