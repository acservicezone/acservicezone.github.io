<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is taken in from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
