<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have actually been properly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent visits, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
