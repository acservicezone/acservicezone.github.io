<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A good place to begin is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there have not troubled with it!

<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more challenging to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity ought to be preserved at or below 65%.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must look out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
