<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
