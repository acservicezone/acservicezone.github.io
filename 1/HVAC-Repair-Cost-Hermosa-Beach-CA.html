<p>I am very satisfied with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years back and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
