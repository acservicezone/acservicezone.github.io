<p>Throughout normal furnace operation, dust, dirt, moisture from humidity or condensation, and microbial growths can build up on internal parts. Airborne components from normal household items and surfaces can lead to formicary corrosion within your HVAC devices. Left uncontrolled, these issues can result in loss of efficiency and even worse, breakdown of part products and a much shorter furnace life expectancy Gradually, crucial components like the heat exchanger, burners or blower housing can begin wearing away, causing reduced efficiency.<p>
<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works however your house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
