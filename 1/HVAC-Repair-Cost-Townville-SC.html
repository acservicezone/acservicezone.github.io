<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
