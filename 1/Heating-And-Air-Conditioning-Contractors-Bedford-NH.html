The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of standard water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank need to be looked for leaks, the system needs to be flushed regularly to remove tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in difficult water locations).

The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to remove dust collected in order to improve collector performance.<p>
