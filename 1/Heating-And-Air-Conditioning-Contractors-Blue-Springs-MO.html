<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Picture 6).<p>

<p>Another technique to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside your home. Many home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window a/c with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of contaminants straight from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>

<h3>AC Repair Cost in Blue Springs MO</h3>
<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have built-in hold-up features. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
