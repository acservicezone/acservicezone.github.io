<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might get in close-by ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
