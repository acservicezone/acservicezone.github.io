<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
