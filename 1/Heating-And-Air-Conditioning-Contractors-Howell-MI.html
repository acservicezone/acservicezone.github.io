<p>There are 2 primary types of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's understood in the house heating organisation. One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are forced to resist current, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we advise utilizing our insulation boards. When utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money. They shows the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of allowing heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
