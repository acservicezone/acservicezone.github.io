<p>When installing a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they should be placed. Many typically they are mounted at height-level or a little lower, if people mainly stay seated in that specific area.

For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside buildings are generally near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is much heavier than air and remains near the flooring.<p>
