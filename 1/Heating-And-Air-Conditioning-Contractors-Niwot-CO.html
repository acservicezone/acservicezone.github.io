<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives ask for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms.

Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item.
