<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit boost. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
