<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat.

The temperature level of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
