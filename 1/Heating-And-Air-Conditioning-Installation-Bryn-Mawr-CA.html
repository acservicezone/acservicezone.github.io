<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
