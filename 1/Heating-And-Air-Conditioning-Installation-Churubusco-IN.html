<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary a/c) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit increase. This boost has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
