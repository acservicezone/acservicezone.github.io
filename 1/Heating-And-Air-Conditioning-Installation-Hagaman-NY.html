A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine components. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, see Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
