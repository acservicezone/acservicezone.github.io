When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components.

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
