<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living centers, medium to big commercial and office buildings such as high-rise buildings and health centers, automobiles such as cars, trains, submarines, ships and aircrafts, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are regulated with regard to temperature and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Air toxins can range from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your animals to dangerous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air pollutant resulting from natural gas that escapes into your house without being burned off. Older homes may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In restrooms and cooking areas, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where wetness levels are generally greater than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
