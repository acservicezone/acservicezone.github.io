A building walk-through to check for odors and try to find water damage, leakages, dirt or pest droppings may be practical. Leaks need to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c systems, on roofs and in boiler pans can end up being infected with fungi or germs and require to be gotten rid of, likewise.
