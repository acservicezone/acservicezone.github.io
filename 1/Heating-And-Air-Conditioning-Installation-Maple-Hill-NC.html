<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. With time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine elements. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
