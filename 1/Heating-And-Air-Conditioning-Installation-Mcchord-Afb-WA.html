<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the task based just on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of affordable ones got. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was respectful of my home and set up the devices in the expected quantity of time. post set up assessment outcomes look very good for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it replaced (also Provider).<p>

Radiant heat offers warmth from the floor up throughout the space without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>
