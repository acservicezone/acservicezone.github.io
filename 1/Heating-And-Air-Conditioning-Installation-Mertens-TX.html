<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by distributing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room.
