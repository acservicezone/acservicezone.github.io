Wetness management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the greater temperature levels often utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for the majority of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to offer thermal comfort inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for mindful attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities generate mold growth and wetness indoors is related to a greater frequency of resident respiratory problems.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
