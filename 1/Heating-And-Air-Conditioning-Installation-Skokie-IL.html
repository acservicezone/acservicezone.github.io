<p>Excellent service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was extremely comprehensive and on-time in explaining what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn offered fantastic client service at the end of the appointment by explaining exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance tasks we might want to have performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics utilized by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release contaminants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
