<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a reference later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>

Pollutants could come from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon going into your home from the ground below. An air pollutant could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or individual care items. Bacteria and infections, animal dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
