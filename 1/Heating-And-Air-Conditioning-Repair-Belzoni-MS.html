According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the very same pollutants.

When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your home.

<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
