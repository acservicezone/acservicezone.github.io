<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Typically the most reliable method to improve indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the amount of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is likewise a more cost-effective approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later on in this section.<p>
