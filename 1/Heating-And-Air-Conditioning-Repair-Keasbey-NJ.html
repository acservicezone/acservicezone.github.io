<h3>The Way to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews at Keasbey NJ</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
