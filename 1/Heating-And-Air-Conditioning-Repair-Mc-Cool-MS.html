<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and really hot beside the radiators. This usually results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your home escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being warmed.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, visit Eric's Garage today.<p>
