<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost great however Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
