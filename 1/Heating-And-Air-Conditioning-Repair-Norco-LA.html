<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled.
