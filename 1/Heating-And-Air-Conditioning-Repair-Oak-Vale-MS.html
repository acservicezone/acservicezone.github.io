<p>To begin, it's an excellent concept to think of energy effectiveness. By selecting a central AC system that has as high of an effectiveness ranking as possible, you can lower your carbon footprint and conserve money in the long run.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
