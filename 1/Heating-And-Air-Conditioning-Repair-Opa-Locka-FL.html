HVAC experts suggest following this basic guideline when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy new.

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside system as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
