<p>Check these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your home are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>
