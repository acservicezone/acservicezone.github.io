<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your home that best temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the road.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
