<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has actually become an essential problem to homeowners and health specialists.

Improperly located outdoor air intake vents can also generate air polluted with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading biological pollutants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>

Electrical power generating companies top the list, with a typical wage of $34.09 per hour or $70,920 per year. Vehicle parts makers, aerospace makers and car producers are all within a couple of cents of each other at approximately $31 per hour, or over $64,000 annually. Railways are another high-wage company, at approximately $29.33 per hour or $61,000 each year.<p>
