<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have concerns, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
