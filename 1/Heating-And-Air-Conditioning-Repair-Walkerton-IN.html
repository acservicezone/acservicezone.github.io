<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
