Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan.
