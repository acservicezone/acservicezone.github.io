<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
