<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to assist keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>Elements that can add to the development of biological contaminants are wet or damp building materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and inadequately maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c. "Humidifier fever" is a common illness triggered by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Different fungi and germs grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these impurities can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological impurities are pets and home plants.<p>
