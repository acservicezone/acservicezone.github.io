<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978.

A qualified technician must fix any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the right quantity of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the performance and effectiveness of your a/c unit is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the maker's specification, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be harmful to the environment.<p>
