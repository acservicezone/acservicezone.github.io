<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the taken in heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was essential and renovated the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater because the professionals thought they simply didn't appear best and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
