We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same toxins.

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. Nevertheless, brand-new installation practices are lowering costs, to the point where the rate is getting closer to conventional systems under the right conditions.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
