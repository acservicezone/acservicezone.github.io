<p>I normally don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>

Also, clean ducts and proper air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the necessary equipment for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still essential to have an expert technician check the system regularly.<p>
