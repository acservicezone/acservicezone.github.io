<p>A geothermal heating unit does not produce its power by burning fossil fuels such as gas, oil, or coal. Rather, it soaks up heat from within the earth. Moreover, a geothermal cooling and heating system uses substantially less electrical energy compared to a basic electric heat-resistance heatpump. This makes a geothermal heater an attractive service to cut your carbon footprint, providing a favorable influence on the environment.<p>
<p>Prior to installing any brand-new heating or cooling system in a house, it is required to re evaluate and minimize the energy load of the house. A more energy efficient home will not only reduce the cost of a new system and energy expenses, however it will greatly enhance the convenience of your home. Before we design and install any systems, we set up a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend improvements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these enhancements. Basic improvements typically consist of adding insulation and air sealing measures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can recommend several certified home Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact United States for recommendations.<p>
