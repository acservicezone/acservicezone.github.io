<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Since it merely takes more electrical power to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
