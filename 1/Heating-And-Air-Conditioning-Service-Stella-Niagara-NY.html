<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
