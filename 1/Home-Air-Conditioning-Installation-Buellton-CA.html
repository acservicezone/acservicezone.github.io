The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and check. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
