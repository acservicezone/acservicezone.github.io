<p>Buildings are developed or meant to react actively to some of these modifications around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems.

In other cases, such changes subtly or perhaps dramatically alter buildings in ways that might be very important to their own integrity or their effect on structure occupants through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time. We may find it helpful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, especially, a few of the methods utilized by scientists studying environments, in order to get an improved understanding of the environments in which we spend most of our time, our buildings.<p>
