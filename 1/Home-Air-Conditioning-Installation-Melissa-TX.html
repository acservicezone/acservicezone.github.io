This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the a/c unit into a heat pump While space cooling provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is generally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
