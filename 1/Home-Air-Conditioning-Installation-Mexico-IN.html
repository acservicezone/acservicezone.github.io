<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to properly service and the unit has actually been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a large seller who asked not to be called since he did not have consent to speak on the record, it prevails for big retail operations to have a group that consistently keeps an eye on energy consumption and temperature levels in shops to save on expenses (especially at night) and to alert store managers if temperature levels in the shops fluctuate outside of an appropriate range that could avoid customers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Finally, if you do identify a particularly energy-efficient in-floor heater and choose to install it in your home, you might be eligible for state or federal programs that can assist cover your up-front contractor expenses. (And these costs can be significant. According to figures gathered by Angie's List, house owners can expect to pay in between $6 and $16 per square foot, not consisting of tax and labor, for a radiant heat system.)
