<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, given that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
