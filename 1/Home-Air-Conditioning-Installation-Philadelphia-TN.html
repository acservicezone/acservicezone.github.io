<h3>Furnace Service in Philadelphia Tennessee</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
