<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>A SEER score represents Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at varying temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the very same duration.

The higher the unit's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>
