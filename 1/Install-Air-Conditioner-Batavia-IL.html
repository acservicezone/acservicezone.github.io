While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a reliable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not need.<p>
