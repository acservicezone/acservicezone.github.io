<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold.

The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>Matters Every Homeowner Knows About Selecting Coal Hill AR HVAC Firms </h3>
