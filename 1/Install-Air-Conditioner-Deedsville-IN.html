<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

When radon becomes trapped in buildings and concentrations develop inside, exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>
