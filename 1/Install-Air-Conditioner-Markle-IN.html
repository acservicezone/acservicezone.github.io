<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals used in the building and construction or remodelling of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops should be used with fans that send out exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating home appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems set up to remove items of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also create particulates and need to be vented outside.<p>

Irritants found in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can become airborne, and hence, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the existence of feline allergen could cause an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>

If several of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
