<p>There are some ranges of mold that contain hazardous compounds (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in most cases, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the launched spores.

<p>If the AC doesn't switch off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not emit heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur in time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay.
