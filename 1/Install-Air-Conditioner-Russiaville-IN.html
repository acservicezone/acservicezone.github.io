Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent study by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground. However much of the important things individuals do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of air-borne contaminants in their houses and worsen asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Instead of incorporating to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. Because as much as 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has a built-in performance advantage. Because they do not require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Because a system is installed in each room or location you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>

<p>The fact is, air pollution in your house can be just as bad - and even worse - than it is outdoors.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
