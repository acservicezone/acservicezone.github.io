<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air.

Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements utilized for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
