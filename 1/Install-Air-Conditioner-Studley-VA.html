<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
