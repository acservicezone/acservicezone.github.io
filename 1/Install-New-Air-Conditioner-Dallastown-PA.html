<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
