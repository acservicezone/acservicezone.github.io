That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In fact, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
