<h3>Air Conditioner Repairs Near me in Mercer Island WA</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>There are a couple of possibilities to explain brief biking in very cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high demands put on the system due to the very low temperatures. In some cases, the furnace will merely run harder to maintain a warm climate for your house when the weather condition is incredibly cold. There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a damaged thermostat. Contact one of our service technicians if you need clarity on this problem.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by experts, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
<p>Replacing your old furnace with a new, more efficient model can combat volatile energy prices, lowering your heating expenses by up to 45%. Improvements in heating innovation have led to systems that pollute less, increase convenience, and last longer. A twenty to thirty years of age furnace usually has an AFUE of about 65%. The lowest effectiveness permitted by law for brand-new gas designs is 78%, and there are numerous options that accomplish 98%, for near total efficiency.<p>
