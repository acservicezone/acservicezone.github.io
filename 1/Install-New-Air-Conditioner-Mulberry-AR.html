<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, many of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a reliable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
