<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Nipomo CA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
