<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers utilized different approaches. The CMHC study called on numerous duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they became part of a study, and the researchers did not control for time invested or approaches used. The EPA study recommended and managed techniques utilized on a smaller sized number of homes. While the duct-cleaning industry argues both studies have defects, no other research study has challenged the findings. And although the devices and methods utilized by duct-cleaning companies have actually changed since these studies were performed, the air ducts in houses haven't.<p>

<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner at Windsor WI</h3>

<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Because it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to run. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down prior to it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
