<p>Air conditioning system makers generally make rugged, high quality items. Begin by checking any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner fails.

<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of pollutant exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor waxing and removing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This permits items to off-gas over the weekend while most of the staff are at house over the weekend. Place control includes moving the contaminant source far from residents and even transferring susceptible residents.<p>
<p>Whatever heater you set up, it's important that it's sized correctly for your house. Too big and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will use excessive energy for the quantity of heat you want produced. If the system is too little, then your home won't be warmed sufficiently and the system will have to constantly run to attempt to heat the entire home, which will increase heating expenses.<p>
<p>Outdoor impurities. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Professionals recommend utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and generally are better for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
