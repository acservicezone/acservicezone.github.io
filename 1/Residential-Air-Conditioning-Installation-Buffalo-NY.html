<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
