<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was kind of odd being that package was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we dealt with problems. I would suggest this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
<p>Air conditioning unit can produce a lot of water because they remove wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can block this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the unit or flood the location. To handle condensate issues, please see Air conditioning system Leaks Water, below.<p>
