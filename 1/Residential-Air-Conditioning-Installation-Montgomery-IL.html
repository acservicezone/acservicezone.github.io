<p>Details offered in this safety guide is based on present clinical and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. Structures constantly progress as a result of the changes in the environment around them along with the occupants, materials, and activities within them. The numerous surfaces and the air inside a structure are constantly interacting, and this interaction results in changes in each. For example, we may see a window as changing somewhat over time as it becomes filthy, then is cleaned, builds up dirt again, is cleaned once again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see might be developing as an outcome of the interactions among the wetness, chemicals, and biological products found there.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the exact same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're dealing with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking equipment will send out the sensor data to the cloud, where you can access it via software. You get immediate, real-time access to the tracking results via a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to decipher.<p>
