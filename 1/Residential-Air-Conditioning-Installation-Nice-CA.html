This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, the majority of commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which may get in neighboring ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical centers and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outside fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>
