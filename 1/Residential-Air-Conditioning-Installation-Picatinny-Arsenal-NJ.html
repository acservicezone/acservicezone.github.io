<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the goal of owning a business was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it took to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners must pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
<p>You could upgrade to the highest performance gear offered and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days. That's since the mechanicals are just part of the central air conditioning system.

Prior to choosing whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining just how much air gets away the system.<p>
