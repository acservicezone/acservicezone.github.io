<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Princeton NJ</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

All wiring for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>We look at ideas prior to we offer advice to replace rather than repair a heating unit. Among the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
