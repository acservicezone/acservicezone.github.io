<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce pollutants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
