<p>The quality of the air inside our work environments, schools and homes matters, especially given that we spend most of our lives indoors. A/c unit help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in extremely damp climates or in cases where the ac system is large, it may not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioning system will require more energy to cool your house. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>

Would suggest them anytime.<p>
