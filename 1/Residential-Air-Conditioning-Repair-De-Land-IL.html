Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been connected to signs like headaches, fatigue, problem concentrating, and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.

In addition, some direct exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not cause instant signs however can cause cancer after several years.<p>
<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more troubles, because a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c separately for each space.

<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank.
