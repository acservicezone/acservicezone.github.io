<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
