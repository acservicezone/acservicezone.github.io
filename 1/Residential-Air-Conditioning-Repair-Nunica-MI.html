Many common building products utilized prior to 1975 include asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Normally, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not take place unless the structure products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation. Because the fibers can be spread out into the air throughout the removal process, elimination of asbestos-containing materials is not always optimum. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing materials is often recommended instead.<p>

My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
