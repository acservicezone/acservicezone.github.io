All of these products are small particles, can become airborne, and hence, are quickly inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks.

<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants.

Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
