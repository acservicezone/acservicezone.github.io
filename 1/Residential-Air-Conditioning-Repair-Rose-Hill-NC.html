He devoted to the job based only on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few affordable ones received. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex priced estimate for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex properly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up group was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install evaluation results look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 heap R22 unit it changed (also Provider).<p>
<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and renovated the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater due to the fact that the service technicians believed they simply didn't seem right and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
