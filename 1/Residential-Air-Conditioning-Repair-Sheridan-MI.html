<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a company was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC company owner should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping costs the very same in all other locations.<p>
