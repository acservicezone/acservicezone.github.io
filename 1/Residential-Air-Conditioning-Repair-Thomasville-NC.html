My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Since an air conditioner moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept clean. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
