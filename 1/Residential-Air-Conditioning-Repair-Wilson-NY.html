<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the water heater because the specialists believed they simply didn't appear ideal and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
