<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Chadds Ford PA</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the task based just on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few sensible ones received. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex properly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up group was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the expected quantity of time. post set up inspection results look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 system it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
