The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)

The female crimp ports ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
