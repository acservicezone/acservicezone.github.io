<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who live in the home. Contaminants might come from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon going into your home from the ground below. An air pollutant could also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care products. Infections and germs, pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>

By selecting a central AC unit that has as high of a performance rating as possible, you can minimize your carbon footprint and save cash in the long run.
