<p>I am an investor, I require to replace two heating systems in a 8000square foot house. Some sources, such as building materials, home furnishings and products like air fresheners, can launch contaminants more or less constantly. Other sources, associated to activities like cigarette smoking, cleaning, redecorating or doing hobblies release contaminants intermittently. Unvented or malfunctioning devices or poorly used items can launch higher and often unsafe levels of contaminants inside your home.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Because as much as 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in efficiency benefit. Because they don't require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Because a system is set up in each room or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
