<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
