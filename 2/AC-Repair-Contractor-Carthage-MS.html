Many times, these units include not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system separately, considering that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are normally only readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capability.
