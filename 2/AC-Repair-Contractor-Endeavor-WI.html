One of the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great chance; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
