<h3>AC Compressor Repair in Faith NC</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. With time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Prior to that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
