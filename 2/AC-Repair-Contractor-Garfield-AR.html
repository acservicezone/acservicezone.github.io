Others were almost two times the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post set up examination outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 unit it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not offer them.. Second of all like prolonged automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
