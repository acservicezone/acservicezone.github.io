<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think of anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The noise level is itâ and low $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
