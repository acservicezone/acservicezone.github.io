"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced.

<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not offer off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen in time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to work until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
