It sounds astounding, however furnace technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been revealed to cause cancer in animals.

Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up.
