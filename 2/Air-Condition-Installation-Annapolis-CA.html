<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Annapolis CA</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the math lately, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>Because an air conditioning system moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept clean. This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
