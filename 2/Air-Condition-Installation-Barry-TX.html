<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate modification affects air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day ac system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c unit should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
