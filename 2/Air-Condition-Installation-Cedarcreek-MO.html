<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner in Cedarcreek MO</h3>
<p>Sean was really valuable. He is a really enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. The only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it really rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
