<h3>Heating Service in Alcoa TN</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat.
