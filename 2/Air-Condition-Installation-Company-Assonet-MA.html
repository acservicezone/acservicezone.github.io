<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should watch out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
