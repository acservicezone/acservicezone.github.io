<p>A packaged system, typically set up on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, but it is likewise a choice for homeowners to consider. Often times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those looking to save money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system separately, given that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are usually just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best alternative for property owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
