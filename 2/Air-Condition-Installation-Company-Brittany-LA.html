<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release contaminants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a home.
