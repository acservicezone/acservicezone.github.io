<h2>How To Hire Affordable HVAC Contractor in Circle Pines</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Right now, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold may be living in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe in addition to the efficiency of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. But a number of the things people do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of airborne pollutants in their homes and aggravate asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters houses through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains, and sumps. Exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon becomes caught in structures and concentrations develop up inside.<p>
