PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump While space cooling supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air.<p>
