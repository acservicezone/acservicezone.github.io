<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that may impact the health of people who reside in the home. Toxins could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground below. An air pollutant might also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or personal care products. Germs and viruses, family pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
