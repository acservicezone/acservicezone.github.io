<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
