<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor wisely, many of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
