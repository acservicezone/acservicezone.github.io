<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average house. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
