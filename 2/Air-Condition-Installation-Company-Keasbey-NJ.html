<p>Mike B., I'm not so sure of that. I have actually got a bud who works in security for a company that produces much of the plastic used all over the world, including EMV.

These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such immediate effects are treatable and generally short-term.

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

From there you can take the appropriate action to deal with the scenario instantly.<p>
