<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the floor as a circulation system. Metal pipes are seldom used due to long-term corrosive concerns. Practically all hydronic radiant flooring heat systems today utilize 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is highly versatile, won't rust and can be found in long lengths, which allow PEX pipe to be woven with minimal or no joints.<p>
<p>In the case of heated water or steam, piping is utilized to carry the heat to the rooms. Many contemporary warm water boiler heater have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the circulation system (instead of older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be moved to the surrounding air utilizing radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be installed on walls or installed within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
