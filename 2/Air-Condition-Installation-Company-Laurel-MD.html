<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner doesn't have the tools or skills essential to check refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and correct airflow are important to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the required equipment for the job. The bottom line?

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
