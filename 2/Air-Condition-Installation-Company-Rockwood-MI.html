Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>I highly advise using this service. Very dependable extremely good. Looked after a part that was not covered under guarantee quickly and efficient and did not have to pay an arm and a leg to get it done.
