<h3>Heat Pump Installation in Cave Creek Arizona</h3>

An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
