<p>The bureau jobs 34 percent employment growth for HVAC service technicians between 2010 and 2020, more than twice the average for all occupations.

However, choose your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
