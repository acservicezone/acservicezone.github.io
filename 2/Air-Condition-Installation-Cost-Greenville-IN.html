<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat.

The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, however it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same.
