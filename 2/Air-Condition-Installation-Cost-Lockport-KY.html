<h3>The Function of the Boiler Burner at Lockport KY</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are incredibly effective, since ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is always at a continuous temperature level. These systems can attain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just attain a performance of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Just like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). POLICE rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling impact. Many ground source heatpump have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this implies is that for every unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
