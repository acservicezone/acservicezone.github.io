<p>Geographically, some areas pay regularly greater salaries for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, unfavorable environment, or just a high level of competitors for skilled trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's greatest average incomes for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 per year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year. Massachusetts and Connecticut completed the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 annually.<p>

Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must do the trick till you purchase a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
