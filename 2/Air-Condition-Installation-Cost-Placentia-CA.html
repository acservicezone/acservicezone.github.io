Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
