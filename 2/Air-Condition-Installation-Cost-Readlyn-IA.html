<p>Prior to you go out and buy an air conditioner, there are a couple of things to choose first. Where are you going to be setting up the a/c? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to install some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioner be? Too large and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c and shorten its life. Too little and your a/c unit will not be able to cool your house effectively. These are just a few of the aspects that you need to consider when purchasing a new AC system. Each choice can and will considerably impact your system's performance, which is why you can't pay for to ignore any of them.<p>
<p>If the AC does not turn off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not release heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur with time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.

<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
