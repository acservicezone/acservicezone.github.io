<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a referral later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
