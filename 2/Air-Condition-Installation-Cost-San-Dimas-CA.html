The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the house.<p>

Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
