<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace in Tappan NY</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Many elements impact IAQ. These factors consist of poor ventilation (lack of outside air), problems managing temperature, low or high humidity, current remodeling, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air entering into the structure. In some cases, specific contaminants like dust from building and construction or renovation, mold, cleaning products, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (consisting of small amounts of chemicals launched as a gas gradually) might cause bad IAQ.<p>
