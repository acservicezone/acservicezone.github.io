<p>When central air conditioning service stops working during a heat spell, you may have to wait days for an HVAC repair technician or an ac contractor to show up, and you'll probably pay at least a number of hundred for the repair.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a recommendation later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
