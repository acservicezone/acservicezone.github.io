<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
