At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump, as well as all other kinds of heat pumps, have effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency, or POLICE. It's a clinical way of identifying how much energy the system moves versus how much it uses. Most geothermal heatpump systems have Polices of 3.0 to 5.0.
