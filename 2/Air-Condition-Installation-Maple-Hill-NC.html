<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>

<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
