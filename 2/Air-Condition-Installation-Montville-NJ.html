After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
