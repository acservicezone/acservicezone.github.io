PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heatpump While space cooling provides optimum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is usually more costly than central air.<p>
