After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, determined particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
