<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Phillips NE Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>In-floor heating systems can include certain health advantages. The hotter the air, the drier it ends up being. On those days when you simply can't appear to heat up and discover you need to show up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your house and leave your sinuses throbbing. In-floor heating systems are not susceptible to this problem since they heat surfaces and not the air itself. Moreover, considering that they do not rely upon fans, ducts, signs up and returns to disperse hot air, in-floor heating systems can reduce the quantity of dust and seasonal allergens in your home.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or completely confine it. Any air flow constraint will reduce the unit's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
