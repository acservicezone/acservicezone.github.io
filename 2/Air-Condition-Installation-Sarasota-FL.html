<h3>Air Conditioning And Heating Companies in Sarasota Florida</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>Old lead-based paint is the most substantial source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging direct exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is improperly removed from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in homes can also result from lead dust from outside sources, consisting of polluted soil tracked inside, and use of lead in particular indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>If your a/c unit is old, consider buying an energy-efficient design. Look for the ENERGY STAR ® and EnergyGuide labels - qualified central systems are about 15% more effective than basic models. New residential central air conditioner requirements entered into result on January 1, 2015; see the performance requirements for central air conditioning conditioners for details, and think about buying a system with a higher SEER than the minimum for greater savings.<p>
