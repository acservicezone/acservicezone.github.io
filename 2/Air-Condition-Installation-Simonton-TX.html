<p>EHSI's indoor air quality group excels in including a multidisciplinary approach to indoor air quality (IAQ) obstacles. When approximating the cost of an installation, a safe cost estimation bracket is in between $10 to $20 per square foot dependant on the kind of system you pick for your house.

<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones.
