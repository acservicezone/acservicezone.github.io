<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical material with time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
