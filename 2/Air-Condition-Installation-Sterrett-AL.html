That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
