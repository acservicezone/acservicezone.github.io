<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your house still heats up to the ideal temperature.

Just be concerned if your home is not warming up. However, if your system does not seem working correctly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you must call in an expert to inspect and repair the system.<p>
