<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network access, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity expert at a big seller who asked not to be called because he did not have permission to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a team that regularly monitors energy intake and temperature levels in stores to minimize costs (particularly at night) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the shops vary beyond an appropriate range that could prevent clients from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, but lots of use the guideline that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is most likely a much better service.

And almost 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
