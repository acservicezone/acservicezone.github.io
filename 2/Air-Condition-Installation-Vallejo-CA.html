Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, throughout brand-new construction (homes normally use between one and 5 tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. However, brand-new installation practices are minimizing costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to standard systems under the best conditions.<p>
