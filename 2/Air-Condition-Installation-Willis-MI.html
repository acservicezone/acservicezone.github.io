<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like prolonged auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to properly service and the unit has actually been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
