<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern a/c) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit boost. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
