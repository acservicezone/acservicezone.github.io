<p>We often set up little built-in electric space heating units when we include or redesign on a room. Unlike heatpump, these systems are self-contained. They are also safe compared to older-style electric baseboard heating systems. They come in many different kinds: wall-mounted systems that are great for little areas like restrooms, cove heating units that resemble baseboard heating units but are tucked safely up by the ceiling, and ceiling-mounted convected heat panels that supply a gentle sunshine-like heat from above.<p>
