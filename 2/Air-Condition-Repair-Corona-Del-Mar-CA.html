The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in monthly, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There should not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
