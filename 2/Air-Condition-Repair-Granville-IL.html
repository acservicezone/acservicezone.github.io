<p>Iâ $ m really choosy with my things. I like my equipment and devices original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with low-cost knock-offs. So purchasing this air conditioner to change my old one was somewhat of a tough fact. You canâ $ t trust the commercial these days. Am glad I got this though due to the fact that it has restored my faith in excellent production. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this brand-new Carrier I got considering that I bought it 7 months earlier. Itâ $ s just perfect.<p>
<p>My oldest son always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I realized that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think about anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy saving too.<p>
