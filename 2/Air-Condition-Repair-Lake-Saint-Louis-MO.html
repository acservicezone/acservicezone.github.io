<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, instead of commercial or outside settings. In tasks where union membership is not a problem, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It might likewise consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to private spaces.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>
