<p>All heating systems have some level of air purification. From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some fundamental maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne toxins flowing through your system. They can likewise keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Please schedule a consultation for a medical evaluation at the University Staff Member Occupational Health Clinic by calling 919-966-9119 if you believe there is a health issue associated to the indoor environment. At this time, you will be asked to complete the Ask for Indoor Air Quality Investigation type (discovered in the Indoor Air Quality Policy). When completing the request that you provide as much detail as possible for the EHS Responder, please submit and complete the kind by means of e-mail or fax It is important.<p>
<p>Often a short-term indoor air quality issue is developed just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term fix might be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. However more complex problems-- identified by consistently undesirable air quality tracking results-- will need a various tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, one of the 3 techniques below might be proper.<p>
