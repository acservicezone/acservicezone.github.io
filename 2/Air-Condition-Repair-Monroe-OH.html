<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered by a Monroe OH HVAC Company</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very happy that somebody as skilled as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to check the air conditioner prior to you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>

He followed through and went above and beyond to personally pick up a required part that was not in stock, guaranteeing repairs were made so that my better half and I would not have to endure another night without heat, during among the coldest winter seasons in current memory.

<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by people and animals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
