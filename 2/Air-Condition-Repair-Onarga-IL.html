<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price terrific however Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
