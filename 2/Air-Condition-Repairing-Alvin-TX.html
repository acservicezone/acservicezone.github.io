More severe than most allergenic residential or commercial properties is the ability of mold to activate episodes personallies that already have asthma, a severe breathing illness.<p>
<p>Some health impacts might appear shortly after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures to a toxin.

<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not provide them.. Second of all like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to correctly service and the system has been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
