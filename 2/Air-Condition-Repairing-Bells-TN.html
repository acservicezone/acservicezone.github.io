<p>Geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types when setting up the whole system. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Setting up one involved excavation, running numerous backyards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This process is quite costly. Setting up a brand-new geothermal heatpump to work with an existing ground loop is far cheaper.<p>
<p>In addition, property owners have a range of choices to pick from in powering a floor heater. Radiant systems work with electrical, natural gas, even geothermal and solar energy sources.
