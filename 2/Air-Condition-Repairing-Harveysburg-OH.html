<h3>Furnace Service in Harveysburg Ohio</h3>
<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>
<p>I have had the enjoyment of working with Pro-Staff Mechanical, Inc. for nearly ten years and during that time, they have constantly provided excellent service. Every person I have dealt with is friendly and professional. The techs are prompt, effective and polite. They aim to finish every job as rapidly as possible and comprehend our financial needs on all 5 of the commercial properties on which I help with the management.<p>
<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
