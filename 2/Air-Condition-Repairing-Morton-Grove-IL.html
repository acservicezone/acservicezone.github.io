Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to provide sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air).
