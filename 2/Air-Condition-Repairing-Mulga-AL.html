<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a variety of impurities that have the possible to adversely affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and really little particles of dust.

<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones.
