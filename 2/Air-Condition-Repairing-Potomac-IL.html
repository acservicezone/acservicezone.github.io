<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

<p>Heat pumps are a dream come true for folks in Seattle. Cooling is something that most Seattleites will just use sparingly, however since heat pumps can provide both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the best of both worlds!

<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are utilized to seeing this type in the yards of houses. With split system units, most of the parts are housed in a metal box outside of the home.

At the very same time, the con would be that those who utilize this may invest more money on cooling costs in the long run due to the fact that of the lower energy efficiency.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
