<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
