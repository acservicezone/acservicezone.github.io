<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)
