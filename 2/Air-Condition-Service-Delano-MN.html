<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics recently, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the patio area where the system sits.

<p>The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in order to decrease the amount of energy needed for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, steps should likewise be required to reduce contamination from sources inside the home.

Additional weatherization measures ought to not be carried out up until these problems have been corrected.<p>
<p>A/c can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space.

Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
