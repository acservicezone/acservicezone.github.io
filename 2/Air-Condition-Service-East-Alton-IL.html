<p>We look at clues before we offer recommendations to replace instead of repair a heating unit. Among the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are greater every year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, but many use the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a much better option. If the current system has not incurred other major repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and problems that resulted in the breakdown can be identified and fixed, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense too.<p>
