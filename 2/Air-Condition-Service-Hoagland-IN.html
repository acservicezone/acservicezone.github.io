<p>Although installation is easy and does not need much time, trying this task is not a good concept. Unless you have training and knowledge of HVAC systems, handling the installation might cause damage or installation mistakes that cause higher utility costs and poor system efficiency.

<p>Energy efficiency can be improved a lot more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heater. Zones are controlled by numerous thermostats. In water heating unit the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the flow of air. In this case, the control system is very important to maintaining a correct temperature level.<p>
