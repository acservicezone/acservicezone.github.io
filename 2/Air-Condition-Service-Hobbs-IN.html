<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside system as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

This usually results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat supplies warmth from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold spots or stuffiness in the location being warmed.<p>
