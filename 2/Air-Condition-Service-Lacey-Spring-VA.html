<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not use auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in monthly, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
