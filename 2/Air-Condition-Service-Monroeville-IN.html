<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
