<h3>Heating Company in Montrose AL</h3>
<p>I have been using them for years for my organisations, my own homes and my property clients' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He assisted me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is truthful, trusted, and reasonable on price. It's tough to find a sincere AC guy and I'm grateful I found Luis. Extremely suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>My oldest boy constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I realized that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually consider anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
<p>This review is for changing a 17 years of age AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who discussed our alternatives did an excellent task in ensuring we comprehended the advantages and disadvantages of each choice. The professionals who installed the new system were expert and fast, while taking some time to ensure we understood how the brand-new system worked. Overall a very first rate experience.<p>
