<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out.

In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To handle condensate problems, please see Ac system Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
