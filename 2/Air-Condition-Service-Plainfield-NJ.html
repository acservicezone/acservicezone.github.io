<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you must look out for. First, you must check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
