If you already have a house heater, you may look for a heatpump more tailored towards cooling capability and performance. For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to search for a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters. The good news is that the one major drawback of heatpump is that they can stop working in the extremely hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise location.<p>
