Forced air heater tend to experience things like duct leaks, which rob them of up to 30% of their output.

<h3>Discontinue Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water in Spanaway WA</h3>
<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by using clever technology. Martin stated the company can develop a control panel within the structure's controls that will offer data on its systems to permit real time visibility, providing the ability to be preventative instead of reactionary. This service can be offered to any commercial customer, not just throughout new building.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
