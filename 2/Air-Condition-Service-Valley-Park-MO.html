<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
