<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Care Tips in Vernon Hills IL</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even little window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for.

Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation.
