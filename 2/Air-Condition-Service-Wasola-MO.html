<p>Geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types when installing the whole system. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
