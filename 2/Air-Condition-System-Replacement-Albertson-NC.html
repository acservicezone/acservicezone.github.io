<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions.

<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roofing system, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for homeowners to think about. Often times, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system separately, given that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are normally just available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to conserve cash on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best alternative for property owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
