The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
