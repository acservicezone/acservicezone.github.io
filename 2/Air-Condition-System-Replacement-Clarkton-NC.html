<p>PE firms tend to run with the goal of selling or spinning off a company at some point. This could be through a public offering, a sale to a large organisation in the field, or perhaps a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE company Ares Management.

<p>Central air conditioners, often described as central air" or split-system air conditioning", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, floors, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the ac system to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
