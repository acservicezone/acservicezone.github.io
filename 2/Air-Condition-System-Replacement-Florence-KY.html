However, since all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is in fact heated, just as by an electric heating system that draws the same quantity of power.<p>

The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most affordable. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

Indoor houseplants need to not be over-watered because extremely wet soil may promote the growth of microbes which can impact allergic people.<p>
