<p>As you usually need to use a self-leveling compound on top of the electric underfloor heating unit, you ought to factor in the time it takes for this to completely dry before the floor covering can be put in place - this is usually a day or 2.

<p>Due to the fact that they remove moisture from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate issues, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
