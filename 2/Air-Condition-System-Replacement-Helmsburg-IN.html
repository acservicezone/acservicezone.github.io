<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
