<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to use vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<h3>Furnace Company in Piney River VA</h3>
<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to lower the amount of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions need to also be taken to lessen pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.) In addition, residents must be alert to the emergence of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization procedures should not be carried out until these problems have been fixed.<p>
<p>Fantastic service within 24 hr and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was extremely comprehensive and on-time in describing what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn offered excellent customer support at the end of the appointment by discussing precisely what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of tips of some maintenance jobs we might want to have performed in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale strategies employed by some in the market.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as crucial when it concerns central air expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to properly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
