<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Pleasant Grove UT</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the entire day as they required to remove the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating unit. We picked getting something more expensive than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our greatest utility costs. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Pleasant Grove UT</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>We recommend utilizing our insulation boards when installing over concrete pieces. When utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a very efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of permitting heat to warm up the concrete slab listed below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
