<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
