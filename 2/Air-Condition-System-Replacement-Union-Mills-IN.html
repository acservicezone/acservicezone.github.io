<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not offer them.. Second of all like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the system has actually been running issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
