<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often referred to as central air" or split-system air conditioning", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floors, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning system to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers.
