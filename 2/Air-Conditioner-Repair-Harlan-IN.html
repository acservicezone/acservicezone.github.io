Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>In addition, worker health signs such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing might be induced as the outcome of temperature extremes, incorrect humidity levels, and too much or too little air blood circulation.
