<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, however it is likewise an alternative for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these units consist of not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, given that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are generally just readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best alternative for house owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
