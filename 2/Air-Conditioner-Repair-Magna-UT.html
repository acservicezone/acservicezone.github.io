Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
