<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the task based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few sensible ones got. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my house and set up the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post set up examination outcomes look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 system it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
