<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
