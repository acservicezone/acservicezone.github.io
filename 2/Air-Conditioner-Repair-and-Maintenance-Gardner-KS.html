<h3>How to Limit the Costs of Air Conditioner Repair at Gardner KS</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We chose getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew just what the problem was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
