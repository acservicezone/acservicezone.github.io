As a society, we ensure that our homes are well-insulated and well-sealed, however we do not think enough about direct exposure to all the things we place in our homes," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a big impact on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea-- right away, they can begin years after exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance.

In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
