Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>You probably know that not every HVAC contractor has the very same focus, skillset, or experience when you start your search for an HVAC contractor in Columbus and surrounding suburban areas. Two local HVAC companies might provide two clearly different set of services, so it's a great concept to research HVAC contractors and examine their websites, reviews and history before you require service.
