<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace at Mission Viejo CA?</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they required to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We decided on getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
