<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
