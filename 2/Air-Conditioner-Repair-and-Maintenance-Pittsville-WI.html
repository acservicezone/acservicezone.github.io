It sounds unbelievable, but furnace professionals frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>It is especially essential to take as many of these steps as possible while you are associated with short-term activities that can generate high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint stripping, heating with kerosene heaters, cooking, or taking part in maintenance and hobby activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding.
