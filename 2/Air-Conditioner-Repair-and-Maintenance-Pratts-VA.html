<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
