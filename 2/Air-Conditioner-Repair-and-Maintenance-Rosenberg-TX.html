<h3>Heat Pump Replacement in Rosenberg Texas</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
