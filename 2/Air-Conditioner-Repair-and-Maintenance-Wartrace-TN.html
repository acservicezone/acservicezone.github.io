<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network access, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity professional at a big merchant who asked not to be named because he did not have permission to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a group that regularly keeps an eye on energy consumption and temperature levels in shops to minimize expenses (particularly in the evening) and to alert shop supervisors if temperatures in the stores vary outside of an acceptable range that might avoid consumers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ may discover moldy or undesirable smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>
<p>This review is for changing a 17 years of age AC with a new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who explained our alternatives did an exceptional job in making sure we understood the pros and cons of each choice. The service technicians who set up the new system were professional and quick, while taking some time to ensure we understood how the new system worked. In general a first rate experience.<p>
