<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it might flatter twice the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output.
