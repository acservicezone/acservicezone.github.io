<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps run on electricity and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heater (like a space heater) with the exact same amount of electricity. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
<h3>Air Conditioning And Heating Companies in Arcadia South Carolina</h3>
<p>As an experienced HVAC expert, we recommend you have your systems inspected and regular maintenance performed two times per year, when in the Spring (prior to cooling season) and once in the Fall (before heating season). It goes without saying the security and convenience of your household or workplace staff are important factors. Keeping what is probably the most costly and crucial system in your house (heating and cooling) effectively maintained will help keep your biggest financial investment of your life in great shape.<p>
<p>Our indoor air quality specialists can transform your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To minimize contaminants, we suggest installing sophisticated air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are designed to eliminate the tiniest particles from the air. The OxyQuantum UV sanitation systems also assist control germs and natural smells. Many store-bought filters can not remove these smallest of irritants and do not eliminate germs and gases.<p>
<p>House owners might likewise presume that since a radiant floor heating system can be viewed (and financed) as a home enhancement, its installation will instantly raise their house's worth. No evidence exists suggesting that in-floor heating either favorably or negatively impacts home worths. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the yearly Cost vs. Worth Report provided by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Remodeling Publication. Maybe Realtors should consider too many variables to definitively specify what a radiant heating system might contribute to, or subtract from, any provided asking price. That said, property buyers wanting to go green," who focus on energy cost savings, or who definitely desire an in-floor heating unit will be willing to pay a premium for a house that includes one.<p>

<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these three things first. Make certain all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). The lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
