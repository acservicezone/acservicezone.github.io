<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Unstable natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals released as gases from items or processes; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.)
