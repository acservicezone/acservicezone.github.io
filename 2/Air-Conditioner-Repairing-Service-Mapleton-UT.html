<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works but your house does not cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
