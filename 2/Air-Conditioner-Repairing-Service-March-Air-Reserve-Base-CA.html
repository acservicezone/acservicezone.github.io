<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company.

You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and should not "require" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I offer you the options for your requirements and you decide if you need it.<p>

<p>My oldest son always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>

If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, although it was six months before the existing one ended. She didn't need a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
