Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them again. Shut off the power. Turn the cooling service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2).

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a difficult task that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps guys working. When a sales man comes to your home he is there to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and should not "require" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I offer you the options for your requirements and you decide if you need it.<p>

<p>My oldest son always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnÃ¢ $ t distribute air like it did before. WeÃ¢ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnÃ¢ $ t truly consider anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is itÃ¢ and low $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement tries to upsell you whenever they come to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, although it was six months before the existing one ended. She didn't need a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
