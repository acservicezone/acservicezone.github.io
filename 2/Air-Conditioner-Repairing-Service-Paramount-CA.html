Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be turned off totally.<p>

I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning.

<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, particularly if the goal of owning an organisation was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners need to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the very same in all other locations.<p>
