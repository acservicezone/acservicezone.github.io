<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
