<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not use them.. Secondly like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the system has been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
