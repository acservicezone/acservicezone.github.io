<p>Terrific Item! Delivery was type of strange being that package was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: purchase recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we solved problems. I would suggest this item to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years back and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
