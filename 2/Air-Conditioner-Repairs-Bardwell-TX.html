<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can manage, a lot of Seattleites should find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in huge box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are snatched up as soon as they're stacked in flooring displays. Seattle might be the last city in the country to face the reality of a vicious, terrible summer.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's providing the service agreement tries to upsell you each time they pertain to perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for seven years, despite the fact that it was 6 months before the current one expired. She didn't require a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
