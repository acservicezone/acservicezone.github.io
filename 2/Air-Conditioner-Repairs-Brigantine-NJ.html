Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
