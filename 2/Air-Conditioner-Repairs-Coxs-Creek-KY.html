<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top, do not position the condenser under a deck or completely confine it. Any airflow constraint will lower the unit's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business many years earlier and understand the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
