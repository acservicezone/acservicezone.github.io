We had actually bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioning unit prior to you purchase. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC systems even in winter. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. Nevertheless, you'll save money over the long term because of the lower energy expenses. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as standard air-source systems. The lack of moving parts means you're less most likely to invest big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're substantially more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
