<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have built-in hold-up features. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might get in nearby ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
