<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
