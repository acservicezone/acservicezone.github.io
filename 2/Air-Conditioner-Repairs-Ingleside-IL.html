<p>Another method to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming indoors. The majority of home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window ac system with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate.
