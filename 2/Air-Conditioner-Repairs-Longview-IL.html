<h3>HVAC Technician Near Me in Longview IL</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
