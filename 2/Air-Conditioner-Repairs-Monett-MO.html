<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven.

For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
