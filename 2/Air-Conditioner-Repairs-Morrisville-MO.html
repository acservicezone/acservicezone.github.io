<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the primary issue. While installing a different split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
