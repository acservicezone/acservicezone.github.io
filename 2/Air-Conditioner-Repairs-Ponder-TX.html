<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
