<h3>Electric Heating System in Portland Indiana</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the go to. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning.

<p>Outdoor contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Experts advise using filters with a MERV 6-8, however higher MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and usually are better for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>

<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very happy that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.)

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to offer sufficient changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common component needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
