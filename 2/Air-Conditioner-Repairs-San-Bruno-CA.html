Some structures can also make use of natural ventilation by opening windows or doors. The ventilation rate" is the amount of outside air presented into a space per a system of time, and is often expressed in cubic feet per minute (cfm).

<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot beside the radiators.
