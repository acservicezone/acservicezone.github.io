Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
