<p>Its special feature is the presence of one primary external unit that linked to several indoor systems. Such systems might be the best service for maintaining the microclimate in numerous workplaces, stores, big living spaces. Just few of outdoor systems do not worsen the aesthetic appearance of the building. The main external unit can be connected to a number of different indoor types: flooring, ceiling, cassette, etc<p>
<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
