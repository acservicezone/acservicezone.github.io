<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the standard water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off totally.<p>

We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit.
