<p>Furnaces as they age risk of developing fractures in the heat exchanger inside your furnace. Carbon monoxide, if present, could leakage into your home undiscovered. Signs of this may be regular headaches, a burning sensation in nose or eyes, queasiness, disorientation, flu-like signs.

<p>Mentioning air, radiant heating systems tend to improve indoor air quality.

Radiant heating systems don't flow air at all, which really enhances your indoor air quality by limiting your direct exposure to high levels of airborne impurities.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works but your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
