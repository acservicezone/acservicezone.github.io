<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, sometimes connected to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
