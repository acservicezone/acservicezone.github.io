<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>

The size of geothermal heatpump and the size of ground loop needed depends upon the heating and cooling requirements for your home and is critical iin ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the system. Capacity for geothermal systems is determined in lots. Usually, a 3-ton setup needs to be adequate for the typical house, however house size, heating and cooling requirements, local geology and soil, and land accessibility are all factors which will affect the right size for your specific home. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heat pump installation and can help you correctly size a system.<p>
