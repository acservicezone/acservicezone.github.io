<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also regulating the temperature level of the flooring. All wiring for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. With time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
