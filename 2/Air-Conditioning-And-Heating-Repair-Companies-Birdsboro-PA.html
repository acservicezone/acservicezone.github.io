<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in great shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most economical. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Through typical use and the system's existence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning system might end up being really dirty. These aspects of the devices are important for effective air conditioning. The technician cleans all parts, and examines connections to guarantee they are secure. The system is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic components are examineded for appropriate function and overall condition. This is an outstanding opportunity to recognize parts that are used or defective. Replacing them to repair the air conditioning might be a lot cheaper when the issue is relatively minor.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from indoors and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is flowed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
