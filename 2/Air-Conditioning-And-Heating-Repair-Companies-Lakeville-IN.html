<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same pollutants. To put it simply, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating elements installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, occasionally linked to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heating.<p>

<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, considering that it is protected indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
