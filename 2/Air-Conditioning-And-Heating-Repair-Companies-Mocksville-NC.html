<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
