<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
