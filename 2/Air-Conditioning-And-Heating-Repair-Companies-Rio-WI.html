<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
