<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is upgraded every four years. The Principles Handbook includes heating and cooling calculations.

<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning a business was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC company owner need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the very same in all other locations.<p>
