I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems besides the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand.
