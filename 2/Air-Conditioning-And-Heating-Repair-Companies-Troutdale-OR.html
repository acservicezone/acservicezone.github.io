<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
