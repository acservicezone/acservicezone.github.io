<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as near to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Ductwork Installation in Wyandotte MI</h3>
<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on among the hottest days of summer( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to evaluate scenario & chose to choose them for the work. I am happy to state that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but also changed the heating unit which was old. Everybody we spoke to from starting to end were very professional, polite and the work was really effectively done. I would highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>The earlier you get in touch with Aire Serv, the faster we can fix your central heat and a/c concerns. In addition to commercial and residential cooling and heating services, our local groups offer other services, consisting of carbon monoxide and smoke alarm installation, thermostat installation, and indoor air quality options such as air purification services and installation of humidifiers and dehumidifiers.<p>
<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends upon the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, variety in price from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heat pumps generally require excavation to install, which adds several thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by individuals and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
