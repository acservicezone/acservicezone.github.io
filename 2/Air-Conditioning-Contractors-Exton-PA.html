<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on among the most popular days of summer( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out very same day to evaluate scenario & chose to opt for them for the work. I more than happy to say that not only did we get the central air going but also replaced the heating system which was old.
