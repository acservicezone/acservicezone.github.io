<p>We take a look at clues before we provide suggestions to replace instead of repair a heating unit. One of the clues we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older unit.<p>

Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also must be properly maintained to avoid bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
