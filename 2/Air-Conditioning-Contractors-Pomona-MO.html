<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now.

He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
