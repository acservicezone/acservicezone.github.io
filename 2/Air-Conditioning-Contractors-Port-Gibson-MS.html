This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
