<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material in time.

Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
