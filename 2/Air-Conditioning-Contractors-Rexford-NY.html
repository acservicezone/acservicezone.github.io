There have actually been uncomfortable noises. I got it examined and fixed. I am hoping that is the end of the issue. In general, it has actually been a good experience. Dependable on the whole. Neat operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its appearances in the beginning. But then realized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
