<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Through normal usage and the system's existence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioner may become very filthy. These aspects of the devices are vital for effective air conditioning.

When the issue is relatively small, changing them to fix the air conditioning might be a lot less expensive.<p>
