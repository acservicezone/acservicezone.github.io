<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit boost. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
