<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>A hydronic heating unit, otherwise referred to as radiant heating, can help you conserve money.
