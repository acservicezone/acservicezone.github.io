<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outside unit as near to your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Cooling can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
