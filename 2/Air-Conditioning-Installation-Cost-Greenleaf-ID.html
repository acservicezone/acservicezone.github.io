If you currently have a home heater, you may look for a heatpump more geared toward cooling capability and efficiency.

This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
