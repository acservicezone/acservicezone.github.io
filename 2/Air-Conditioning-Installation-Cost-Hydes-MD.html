Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated procedure. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather expensive.<p>
