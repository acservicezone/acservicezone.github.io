<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been correctly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
