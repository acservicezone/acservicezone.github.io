<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " number one environmental danger to the health of kids in the United States."

When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead enters the body.

<p>The split system is the most typical. Most people are utilized to seeing this enter the yards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the elements are housed in a metal box outside of the house. However, there are some internal elements as well. Split systems are ideal for cooling numerous spaces simultaneously, but are not really energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud devices in the house.
