<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>We take a look at hints prior to we provide guidance to change instead of repair a heater. Among the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater every year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older system.<p>
