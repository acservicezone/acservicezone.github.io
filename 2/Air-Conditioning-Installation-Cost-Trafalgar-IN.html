<p>All houses need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been burnt out from use. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the appropriate temperature level. Furnaces that kick on regularly may be due to a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous.

<h3>Air Condition Company in Trafalgar IN</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
