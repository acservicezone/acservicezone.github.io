<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
