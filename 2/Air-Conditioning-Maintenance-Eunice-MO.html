They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they needed to order it. My better half said that she had seen a great review for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent people I have satisfied in a long period of time.
