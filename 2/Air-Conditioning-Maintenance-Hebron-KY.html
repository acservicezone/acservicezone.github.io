Once the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Don't put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively solidify and treat-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
