<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest will not come on. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that secure your cooling system from flooding. One of the most common locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan.
