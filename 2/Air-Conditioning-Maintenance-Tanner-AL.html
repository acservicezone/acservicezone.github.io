<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
