<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot beside the radiators. This normally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your home escape out of the window.

If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
