<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot beside the radiators. This normally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your home escape out of the window. Convected heat supplies heat from the flooring up throughout the room with no cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>

Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
