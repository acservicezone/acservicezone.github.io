<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly put or kept evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might get in neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis.

The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
