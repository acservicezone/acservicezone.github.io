<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution.
