<h3>What You Will Need to Know About Air Conditioner Repair at Deer Park TX</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
