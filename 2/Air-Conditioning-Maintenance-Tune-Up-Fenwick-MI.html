<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Because pesticides can be discovered far from the website of their original application, it is prudent to lower using chemical pesticides outdoors as well as indoors. Depending upon the site and insect to be managed, one or more of the following actions can be effective: usage of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; selection of disease-resistant plants; and regular washing of indoor plants and family pets. Termite damage can be minimized or avoided by making sure that wooden building products do not enter direct contact with the soil and by storing fire wood away from the house. By appropriately fertilizing, watering, and aerating lawns, the need for chemical pesticide treatments of lawns can be drastically decreased.<p>
