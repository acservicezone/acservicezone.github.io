<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Correct ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same toxins. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>If you work in construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator service center or lead factory, or your hobby includes lead, you might unconsciously bring lead into your home on your clothing or hands. You may also be tracking in lead from soil around your house. Soil extremely close to homes might be contaminated from lead paint on the exterior of the building. Soil by roadways and highways might be polluted from years of exhaust fumes from automobiles and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to wipe your feet prior to going into the home. If you work with lead in your task or a hobby, change your clothing before you go home and wash these clothing separately. Encourage your children to play in sand and grassy areas instead of dirt which adheres to toys and fingers. Attempt to keep your kids from eating dirt, and make sure they clean their hands when they come inside.<p>

<p>After the system has actually been checked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation.
