<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ may see unpleasant or musty odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>

The 2 operations use various processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to achieve its aims.<p>
