<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
