Children may have higher direct exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in gathering information on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily handle the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
