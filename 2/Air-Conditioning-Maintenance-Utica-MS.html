<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>In a location where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good primary heating unit. You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing. Your heating technician can install controls which instantly shut down the heat pump if temperature levels reach and drop below freezing. The controls will require the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the house in these conditions.<p>

<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best feature of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Also they diagnosed the concern and fixed really quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Filters can get filthy easily, specifically if you reside in a place that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, particles, germs, and tidy the air. They're responsible for maintaining the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned and changed regularly, your HVAC system will ultimately stop carrying out as you anticipate it to. The heating and cooling will mishandle and the indoor air quality will intensify. Checking and altering the air filters is among the most essential elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
