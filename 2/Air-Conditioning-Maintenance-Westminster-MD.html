<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
