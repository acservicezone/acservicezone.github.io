An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite considerable.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioners and refrigerators employed flammable or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
