<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the goal of owning a company was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners ought to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the exact same in all other areas.<p>
