<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
