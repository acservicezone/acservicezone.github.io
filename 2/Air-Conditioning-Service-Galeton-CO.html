<p>In a packaged central air conditioning conditioner, the compressor, evaporator, and condenser are all located in one cabinet, which usually is put on a roofing system or on a concrete piece beside the house's structure. This type of a/c unit also is used in little commercial structures. Air supply and return ducts originate from inside through the home's exterior wall or roofing to get in touch with the packaged a/c unit, which is typically situated outdoors. Packaged a/c frequently consist of electric heating coils or a natural gas furnace. This mix of ac system and central heating system gets rid of the requirement for a different furnace indoors.<p>
