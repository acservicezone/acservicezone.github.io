Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I seem like they give me preferential treatment, and want to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>

Other sources, associated to activities performed in the home, release pollutants intermittently.
