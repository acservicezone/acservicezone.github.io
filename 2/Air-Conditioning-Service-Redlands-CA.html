<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
