<h3>Truth All Homeowners Should Know About HVAC Installation in Camp Dennison OH</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even little window plan units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
