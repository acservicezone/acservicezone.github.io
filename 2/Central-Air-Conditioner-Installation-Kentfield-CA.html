Radon problems in water can be easily fixed. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors.

Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
