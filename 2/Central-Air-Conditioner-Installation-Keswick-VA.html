<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. The possibility of instant responses to indoor air toxins depends on several factors consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether an individual reacts to a pollutant depends upon individual level of sensitivity, which varies enormously from person to individual. Some people can become sensitized to chemical or biological pollutants after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring equipment will send the sensor data to the cloud, where you can access it through software application. You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results via a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to understand.<p>

<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was sort of strange being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we resolved concerns. I would recommend this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
