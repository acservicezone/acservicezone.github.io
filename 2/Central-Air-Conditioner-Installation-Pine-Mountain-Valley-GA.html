<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ might notice musty or unpleasant odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems.
