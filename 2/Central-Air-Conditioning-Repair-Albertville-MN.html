<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to supply enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
