<p>While contaminant levels from individual sources may not pose a considerable health danger by themselves, a lot of homes have more than one source that adds to indoor air pollution. There can be a serious danger from the cumulative effects of these sources. Fortunately, there are actions that the majority of people can take both to decrease the threat from existing sources and to avoid brand-new problems from taking place. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to take actions that can minimize the level of indoor air contamination in your own home.<p>
<p>The probability of instant reactions to indoor air toxins depends upon a number of elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 crucial influences.
