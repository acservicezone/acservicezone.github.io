<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Since it tires warm air out the top, don't put the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it. Any air flow limitation will reduce the unit's performance. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
<p>When installing over concrete pieces, we advise using our insulation boards. When used in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a really effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of allowing heat to warm up the concrete slab listed below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
