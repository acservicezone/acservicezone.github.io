<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
