<p>Improve your services, earn more services earnings, and provide an amazing client experience. To ensure the system you select is the ideal size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation estimate to determine the specific kind of heat and air conditioning system that's perfect for your home-we do not just change it with the same size unit you presently have. These computations take into account things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is vital so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>
