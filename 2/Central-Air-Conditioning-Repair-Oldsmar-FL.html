Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the registers.

These investigations exposed that correct ventilation is necessary in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>

This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
