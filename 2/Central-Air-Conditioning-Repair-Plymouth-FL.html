<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything.

This does not sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning a service was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion objective.
