<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide automobile debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
