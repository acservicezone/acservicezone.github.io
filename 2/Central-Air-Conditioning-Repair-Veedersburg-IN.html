<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from use. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the correct temperature level. Furnaces that kick on often may be because of a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal concern.

An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
