<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Service in Brooks KY</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. Make certain to have those dimensions on hand when buying an air conditioning unit to ensure it'll fit easily into the window.
