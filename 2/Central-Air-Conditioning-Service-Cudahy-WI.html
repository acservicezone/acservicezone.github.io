<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Cudahy WI</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the problem and fixed extremely quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
