<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to provide your house that ideal temperature level all year round.

So, be sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get an air conditioning service plan which normally consists of a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>

After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He needed to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
