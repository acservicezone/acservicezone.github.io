<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Because it merely takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a chance to distribute the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
