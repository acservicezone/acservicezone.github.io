<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
