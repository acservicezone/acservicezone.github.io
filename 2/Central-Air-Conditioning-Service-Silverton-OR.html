Purchased a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
