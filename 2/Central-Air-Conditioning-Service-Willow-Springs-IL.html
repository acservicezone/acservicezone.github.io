<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Willow Springs IL</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit. We picked getting something more pricey than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
