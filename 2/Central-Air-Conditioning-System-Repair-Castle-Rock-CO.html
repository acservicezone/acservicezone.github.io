<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>

The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. It can become air-borne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
