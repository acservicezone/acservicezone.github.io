<p>Using a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly reduces direct exposure to toxins throughout cooking. Inappropriate change, often suggested by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, causes increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue. Consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot light that burns continually if you purchase a new gas stove or range. Never utilize a gas stove to heat your house. Constantly ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in usage.<p>
