<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>I am very impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site.
