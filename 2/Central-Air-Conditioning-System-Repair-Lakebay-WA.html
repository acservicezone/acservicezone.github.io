<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
