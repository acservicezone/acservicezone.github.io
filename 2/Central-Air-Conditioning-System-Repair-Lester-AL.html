<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works however your house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
