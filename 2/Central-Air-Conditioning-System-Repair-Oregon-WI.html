One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the flooring surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the floor are forced to resist present, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 Â° F and an indoor temperature of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
