<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC system than a smaller house, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be severe. They consist of hold-ups in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, babies, and kids are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than grownups considering that lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the destructive results of lead. Children may have higher exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
