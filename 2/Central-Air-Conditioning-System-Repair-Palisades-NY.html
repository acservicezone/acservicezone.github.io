<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, schools and homes matters, particularly since we invest the majority of our lives indoors. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in exceptionally damp climates or in cases where the air conditioner is extra-large, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioning system will need more energy to cool your home. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to the majority of existing systems.<p>
