<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening. When going shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit comfortably into the window, be sure to have those dimensions on hand.

Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution.
