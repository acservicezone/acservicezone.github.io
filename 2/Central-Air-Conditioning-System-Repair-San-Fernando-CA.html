<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles.

In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>
