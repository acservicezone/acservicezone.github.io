<p>The homes and structure of the soil in a location can affect the rate at which heat is carried out through the ground.

<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC.
