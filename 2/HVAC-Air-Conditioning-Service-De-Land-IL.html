<p>The most underrated HVAC element in your cooling system is the evaporator & condenser coil. When making a huge HVAC decision on changing your devices, many individuals believe the compressor is the only component that matters. Many air conditioning replacements happen when the emergency ac repair Houston Heights 77007 77008 is with your coils, not your compressor. When the copper or aluminum coils start to rust, refrigerant leakages happen.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
