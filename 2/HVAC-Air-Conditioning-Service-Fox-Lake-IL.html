<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out.

The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
