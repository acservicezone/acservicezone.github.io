(If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.)

For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
