<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
