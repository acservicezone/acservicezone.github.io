<p>It is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists if no contaminant sources are found. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for a boost in the number of employees in the location, stagnant air might likewise be a problem.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump cost is much more than other heat pump types when installing the whole system. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Setting up one involved excavation, running hundreds of backyards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This procedure is rather expensive. Setting up a new geothermal heatpump to deal with an existing ground loop is far less expensive.<p>
<p>Prior to cooling or setting up any new heating system in a home, it is needed to re assess and reduce the energy load of the house. A more energy effective house will not only minimize the cost of a brand-new system and utility expenses, but it will significantly enhance the comfort of your house. Prior to we design and install any systems, we set up a house energy audit in which an energy auditor will advise enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these improvements. Fundamental enhancements typically consist of adding insulation and air sealing steps. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can advise a number of qualified home Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact Us for recommendations.<p>
