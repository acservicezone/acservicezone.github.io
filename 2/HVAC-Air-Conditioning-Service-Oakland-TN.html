<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
