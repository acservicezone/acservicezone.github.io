<p>The purpose of the majority of building ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for occupant comfort while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing safety at affordable energy costs. Your furnace has many elements that can impact the health and safety of you and your loved ones. Having a total check of your furnace will offer assurance that it is safe to operate.
