ProTex correctly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my home and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post set up evaluation results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 system it changed (also Provider).<p>

However, choose your contractor carefully, many of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales strategies that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a reputable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the exact same).
