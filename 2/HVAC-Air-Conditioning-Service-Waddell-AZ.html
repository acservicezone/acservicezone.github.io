<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
