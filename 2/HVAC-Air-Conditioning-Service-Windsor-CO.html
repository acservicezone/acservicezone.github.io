<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
