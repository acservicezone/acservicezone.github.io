<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems in Ypsilanti MI</h3>
<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while concurrently eliminating waste gases and particulates. Needless to state, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the harder it is for your lungs to remove them. Poor air quality - whether it is indoors or outdoors - can make it increasingly difficult for your lungs to operate correctly, and can have negative health impacts.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
