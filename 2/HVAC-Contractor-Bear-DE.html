<p>Information offered in this safety guide is based on present scientific and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. The requirements do not require you to change your existing central air units, and replacement parts and services must still be offered for your house's systems. The "lifespan" of a central air conditioning conditioner is about 15 to twenty years. Manufacturers normally continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts available and honoring maintenance contracts after the brand-new basic goes into impact.<p>
<p>The first a/c and refrigerators employed toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might result in deadly mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
