<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
