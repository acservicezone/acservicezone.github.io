<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your house that best temperature throughout the year.

So, make certain to change your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service strategy which normally consists of a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
