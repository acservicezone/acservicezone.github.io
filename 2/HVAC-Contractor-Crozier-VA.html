<p>Your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a range of impurities that have the potential to negatively affect your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, germs, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if required, update the building envelope. For instance, he might seal gaps and fractures in the external walls and attic floor, or he may blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation may be a more effective solution to your cooling problems than changing your devices.<p>

Loosen the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new unit (Image 6).<p>
