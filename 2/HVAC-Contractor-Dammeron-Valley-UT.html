<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a very pleasant individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns besides the blower motor. The only reason he could not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
