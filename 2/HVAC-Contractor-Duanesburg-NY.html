<h3>How to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Duanesburg NY</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very pleased that somebody as skilled as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to check the a/c prior to you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and renovated the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater because the technicians thought they just didn't appear right and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
