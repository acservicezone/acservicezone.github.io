<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps simply as essential when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, however will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not have the ability to effectively cool the house on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
