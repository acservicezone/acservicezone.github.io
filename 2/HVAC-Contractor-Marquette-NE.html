<p>Specialist heating system setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually fail. HVAC professionals recommend following this basic guideline when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the price of a new system, it's finest to buy new.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not use auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of money being available in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
