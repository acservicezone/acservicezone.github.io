<h3>Window Air Conditioner in Norman IN</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then determine the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to guarantee it'll fit conveniently into the window, be sure to have those dimensions on hand.
