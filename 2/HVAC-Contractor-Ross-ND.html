<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
