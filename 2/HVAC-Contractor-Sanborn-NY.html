<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off toxins.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Advanced designs of new homes are starting to feature mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home. A few of these designs consist of energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (also called air-to-air heat exchangers). For additional information about air-to-air heat exchangers, call the Conservation and Renewable Resource Query and Recommendation Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
