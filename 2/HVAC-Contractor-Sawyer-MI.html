<h3>The Advantages of Buying A New Furnace in Sawyer MI</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and really clear about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
