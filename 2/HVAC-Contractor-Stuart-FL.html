<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job finding the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>HVAC Repair in Stuart Florida</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter as soon as every 3 months. During high use months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>
