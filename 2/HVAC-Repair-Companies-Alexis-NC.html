<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Occupational direct exposure limitations use dose-response data which show the health effects of repeated exposure to one specific chemical. Similar data is not readily available for long-lasting, low-level exposures to a mix of impurities as is the case for IAQ problems.
