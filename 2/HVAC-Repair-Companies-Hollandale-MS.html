<p>A health survey should be developed and dispersed to all concerned employees. Such a tool must determine the number of people impacted; specify ages and task descriptions of involved workers; identify where they lie within the office; indicate when the signs occur (time of day, day of week, and time of year); provide a list of specific health symptoms or health problems; identify all devices operated in the office; indicate the kind of outside air pollution; and recognize possible sources of task stress.<p>
<p>To help health centers treating patients with the unique coronavirus (COVID-19), Provider launched the OptiClean portable negative air machine, which cleans up and gets rid of air possibly polluted by the infection.
