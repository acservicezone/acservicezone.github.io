<h3>Radiant Heating System in Lexington TN</h3>
<p>If you set it too low, you're encouraging the development of mold in damp air. The heat dries the air, preventing mold development and pollution. Of course, too-dry air can likewise irritate your lungs and sinuses, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the growth of germs and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
