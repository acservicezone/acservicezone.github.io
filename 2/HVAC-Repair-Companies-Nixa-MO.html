<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only an experienced HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in pricey compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the abilities or tools needed to examine refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and proper air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however homeowners do not have the required devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still essential to have an expert technician examine the system occasionally.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ may observe musty or unpleasant smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical product gradually. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
