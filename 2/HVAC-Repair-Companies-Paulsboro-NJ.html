<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and place of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday.

Place control includes moving the toxin source far from residents or even moving prone occupants.<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most inexpensive if your home or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
