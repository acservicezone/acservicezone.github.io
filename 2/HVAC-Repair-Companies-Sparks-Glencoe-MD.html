<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Lots of common building materials used prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating unit, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Generally, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the building products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Due to the fact that the fibers can be spread out into the air throughout the removal procedure, removal of asbestos-containing materials is not always ideal. A management program for undamaged asbestos-containing products is typically suggested instead.<p>

The unit runs silently and effectively, but to have two significant parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
