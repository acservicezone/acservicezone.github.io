<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not provide off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur over time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick till you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
