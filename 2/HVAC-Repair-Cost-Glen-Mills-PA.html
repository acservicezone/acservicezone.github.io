<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based on the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor home appliances through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Heat pumps are a dream come true for folks in Seattle. Cooling is something that the majority of Seattleites will just use moderately, however due to the fact that heat pumps can offer both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the very best of both worlds! Not just are heat pumps convenient, they are very energy efficient, too. The best time to install air conditioning in your house may very well be when your heating system breaks down if a heat pump is in your future.<p>
<p>A 3rd method to choose whether your house might have bad indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, try to find indications of problems with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can indicate your house may not have enough ventilation include wetness condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or foul-smelling air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become moldy. To detect odors in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether smells are obvious.<p>
<p>In some cases a momentary indoor air quality issue is created merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity taking place inside a room or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term repair might be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. However more complex issues-- determined by regularly inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will require a different tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, among the three methods below may be suitable.<p>
