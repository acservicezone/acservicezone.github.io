This step is necessary so the unit isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER rating of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period. Basically, SEER offers more data based upon how the EER carries out in different temperatures. The higher the unit's SEER rating, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER rating can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all appliances.<p>
