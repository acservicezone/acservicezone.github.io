We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same contaminants. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas.

Exposure to radon ends up being an issue when radon becomes caught in concentrations and structures build up inside your home.<p>
