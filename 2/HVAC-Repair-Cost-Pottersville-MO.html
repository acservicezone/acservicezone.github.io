Throughout high use months, examine the filters at least regular monthly.<p>

On those days when you just can't appear to heat up and find you require to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses throbbing. In-floor heating systems are not susceptible to this problem since they heat surfaces and not the air itself.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
