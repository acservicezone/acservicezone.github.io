<p>There are numerous actions a property owner can require to choose items that will avoid indoor air problems from happening - a couple of them are pointed out here. Initially, use exterior-grade pushed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinets, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, consider using strong wood items. Secondly, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make sure that an effective moisture barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. If it becomes wet, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of.<p>
