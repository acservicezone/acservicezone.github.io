<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>I am very amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years ago and understand the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
