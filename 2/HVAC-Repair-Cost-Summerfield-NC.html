<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Iâ $ m really picky with my things. I like my devices and appliances original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with inexpensive knock-offs.

Since it has restored my faith in good production, am grateful I got this however. I havenâ $ t had a problem with this brand-new Carrier I got considering that I purchased it 7 months back. Itâ $ s just perfect.<p>
