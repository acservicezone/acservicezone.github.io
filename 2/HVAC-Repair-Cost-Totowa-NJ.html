<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Totowa NJ?</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
