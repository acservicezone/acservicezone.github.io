A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air conditioning unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy efficient than designs made even 5 years back, so it makes monetary sense to change or update your unit if it's five years of ages or older.

EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your risk of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
