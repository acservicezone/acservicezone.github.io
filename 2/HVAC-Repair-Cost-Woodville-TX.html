<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you wish to get those capacitors altered to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
