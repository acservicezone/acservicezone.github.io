<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil.
