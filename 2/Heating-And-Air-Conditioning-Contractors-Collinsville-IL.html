<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and people; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
