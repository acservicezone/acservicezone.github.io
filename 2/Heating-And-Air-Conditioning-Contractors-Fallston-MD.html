<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them till they have actually been correctly dried.
