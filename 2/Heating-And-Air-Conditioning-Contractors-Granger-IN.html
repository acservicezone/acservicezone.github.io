I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day.
