<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Jasper AR</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
