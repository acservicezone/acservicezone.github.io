<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
