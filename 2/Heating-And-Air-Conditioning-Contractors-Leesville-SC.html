<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heating systems are still widely used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often described as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, occasionally linked to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the technique is described as radiant heating.<p>
