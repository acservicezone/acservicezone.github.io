<p>Many individuals undervalue the level of the indoor air pollution problem. Air pollution is usually imagined as the black smoke given off from factories.

PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two different units (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioner into a heat pump While space a/c supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool numerous rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
