<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
