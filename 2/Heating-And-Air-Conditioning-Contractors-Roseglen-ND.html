The systems need to be inspected at least twice each year for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed occasionally to remove dust collected in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>

<p>This is especially notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>If your single stage a/c unit isn't old enough to validate replacement, think about a whole house dehumidifier. By setting up dehumidification equipment inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy some of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without replacing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, enhancing indoor air quality and enabling higher convenience at greater temperature levels.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
