<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location.

<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Santa Monica CA Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
