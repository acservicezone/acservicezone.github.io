<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
