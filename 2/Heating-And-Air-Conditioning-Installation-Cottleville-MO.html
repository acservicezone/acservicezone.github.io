<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you ought to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
