<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. When the wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively solidify and treat-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
