<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
