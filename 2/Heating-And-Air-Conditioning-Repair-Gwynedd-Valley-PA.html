<h3>HVAC Systems Are Essential for All Homes and Offices in Gwynedd Valley PA</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
