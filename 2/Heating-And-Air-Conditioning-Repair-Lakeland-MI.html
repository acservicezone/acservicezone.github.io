<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly receives ask for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be quickly incorporated with existing systems such as standard forced air or radiant floor heating or can be installed in a brand-new structure.

Capability for geothermal systems is determined in loads. Generally, a 3-ton setup needs to be enough for the average home, but house size, heating and cooling requirements, local geology and soil, and land availability are all aspects which will influence the right size for your particular house.

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
