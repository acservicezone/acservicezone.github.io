<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years earlier and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
