<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, most Midtown Houston Tx customers do not know why their HVAC system is not working.

Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil.
