<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up.

Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
