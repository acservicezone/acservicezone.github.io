<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not get rid of the mold.

The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the patio where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
