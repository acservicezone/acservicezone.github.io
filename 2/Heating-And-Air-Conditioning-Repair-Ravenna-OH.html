If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

<p>The predominant health impact associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
