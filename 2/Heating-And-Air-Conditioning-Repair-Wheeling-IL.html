The job of an HVAC technician is relatively complicated and can differ considerably from one home or office to the next. Every maintenance job and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance job might require completely different steps and procedures than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being checked. Setups can also vary substantially, depending upon the age of the structure and how well the existing system was set up. In some cases, totally new ductwork may need to be installed in a structure that had none prior to.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor unit as near the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by lots of individuals.<p>

<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window.

You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
