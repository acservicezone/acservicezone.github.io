<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have offered an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. But according to a cybersecurity professional at a large retailer who asked not to be called due to the fact that he did not have permission to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a group that routinely keeps an eye on energy consumption and temperatures in stores to save money on costs (particularly at night) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the shops fluctuate outside of an appropriate range that might prevent customers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ might observe moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues.

Because overly damp soil may promote the development of bacteria which can affect allergic people, indoor houseplants need to not be over-watered.<p>
