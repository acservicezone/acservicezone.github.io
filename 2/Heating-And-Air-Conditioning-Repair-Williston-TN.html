<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema.

Review of this information might identify possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of data might not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
