<p>My eldest boy constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him but then I realized that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really consider anything else other than replacing it. The one I got deserves every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
<p>This review is for changing a 17 year old AC with a new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who described our options did an outstanding job in making certain we understood the pros and cons of each option. The specialists who installed the new system were professional and fast, while taking time to make certain we comprehended how the brand-new system worked. In general a first rate experience.<p>
