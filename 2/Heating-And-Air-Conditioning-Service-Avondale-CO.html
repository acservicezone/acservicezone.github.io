<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same.

Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately harden and cure-- typically 2 to four weeks.
