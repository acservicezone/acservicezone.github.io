<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the boost it needs from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can often conclude that the capacitor has failed. Sometimes you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the opportunities are good that this might work for one cycle, however the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>
<p>Some health effects might show up quickly after a single exposure or duplicated exposures to a contaminant. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate results are treatable and typically short-term. Sometimes the treatment is merely getting rid of the individual's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Right after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants, symptoms of some illness such as asthma may appear, be exacerbated or gotten worse.<p>
<p>The basic duties of an HVAC technician consist of setting up, maintaining, and repairing heating, refrigeration, and air systems.

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
