<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized.
