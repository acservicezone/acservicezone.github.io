<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the a/c. I proceeded and bought this Carrier and I must say it gets the job done rather well. It takes extremely little time to warm up or cool down your home which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t obtain from the one we had previously. The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year shut down the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
