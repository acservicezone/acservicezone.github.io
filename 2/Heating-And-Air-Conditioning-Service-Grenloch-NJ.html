<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your home that best temperature level throughout the year.

So, make sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an air conditioning service plan which usually consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues.
