<p>Many commercial structures utilize mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that belong to the heating and HVAC systems. Some structures can likewise make use of natural ventilation by opening windows or doors. The ventilation rate" is the amount of outside air introduced into an area per an unit of time, and is often revealed in cubic feet per minute (cfm).

Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen gradually since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts.
