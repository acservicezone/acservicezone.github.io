<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>A car's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being filthy and old. The old coolant will negatively impact the system's efficiency. To make sure the system is working efficiently, think about having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Car Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures through natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
