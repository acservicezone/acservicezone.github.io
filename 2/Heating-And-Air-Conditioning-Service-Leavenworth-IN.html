<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Advanced ventilation systems that make it possible for greater airflow from the outdoors, air quality monitoring platforms and sensing units, and brand-new air filtration technologies are ending up being more typical as available services in residential and commercial HVAC item bundles. Adoption of these technologies, however, has not been widespread, as customers remain largely oblivious to the results of air quality on health and efficiency.<p>
<p>Some biological impurities trigger allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some kinds of asthma. Contagious health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the air. Mildews and molds launch disease-causing contaminants. Signs of health issue brought on by biological contaminants consist of sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, lethargy, fever, and digestion problems.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, but it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have a negative impact on residents-- outdoors air should be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
