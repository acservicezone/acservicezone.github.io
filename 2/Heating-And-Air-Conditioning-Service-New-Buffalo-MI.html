<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
