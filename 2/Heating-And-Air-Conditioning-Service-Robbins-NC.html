<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one constraint: their total power should not go beyond the capacity of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outside capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, since the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor system. Basically, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not simple, since it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the units, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>Radiant heating provides a variety of distinct benefits over forced air heating systems. For example, radiant heat systems are more energy effective than forced air systems.

Sending heat through strong items will also trigger it to last longer than utilizing air as a thermal medium. A house heated by a glowing system will warm up quicker, and stay warm with less energy spent. These are just a few of the many benefits that a radiant heating system can offer you.<p>
