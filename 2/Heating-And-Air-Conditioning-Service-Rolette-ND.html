<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives ask for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The probability of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends upon several aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions.

Some people can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical toxins after repeated or high level direct exposures.<p>
