<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor unit as close to the house as possible per my demand.

<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the job based just on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday).

ProTex appropriately advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install group was respectful of my home and set up the devices in the expected quantity of time. post set up examination outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 heap R22 unit it changed (also Provider).<p>
<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it just takes more electricity to run a larger system. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off prior to it has a possibility to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In truth, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
