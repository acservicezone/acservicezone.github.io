<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. If your air conditioning system is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. Just including refrigerant is not a service if it leakages. An experienced technician must fix any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant.

Refrigerant leaks can also be harmful to the environment.<p>

"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
