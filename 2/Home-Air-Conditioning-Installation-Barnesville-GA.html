<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise because 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power should not go beyond the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems greater than the outside capacity by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, since the overall capability of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outside system. Put simply, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that a few of the spaces might not have a very comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the overall power is not basic, since it takes into account not just the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more difficulties, considering that some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>
