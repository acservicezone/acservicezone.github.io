<p>In general, ductless AC units are more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient than traditional A/cs. This is because you can shut off specific spaces when you're not occupying them.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them up until they have actually been effectively dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
