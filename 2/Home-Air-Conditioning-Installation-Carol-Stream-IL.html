<h3>Central Heating Repair in Carol Stream IL</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my organisations, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the problem. He is honest, trustworthy, and reasonable on rate. It's tough to find an honest AC person and I'm happy I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
