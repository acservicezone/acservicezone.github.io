<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>We suggest yearly preventative Maintenance for your heating and cooling systems. Maintenance services will not only ensure that your system is running as efficiently as possible, but will also guarantee security. From replacing your systems filters and lines, to examining the voltages for electronic components, we run an extensive maintenance check. Offer us a call today to arrange your maintenance service.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to provide enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A common aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
