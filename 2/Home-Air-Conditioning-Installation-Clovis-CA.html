<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release contaminants.)

<p>The primary health result associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
