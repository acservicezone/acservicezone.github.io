<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
