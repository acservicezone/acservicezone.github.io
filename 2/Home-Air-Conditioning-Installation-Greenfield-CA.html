If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure.
