<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Manchester PA</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 Â° F and an indoor temp of 80 Â° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
