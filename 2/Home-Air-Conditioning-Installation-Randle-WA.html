<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Randle WA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger a problem in the future.
