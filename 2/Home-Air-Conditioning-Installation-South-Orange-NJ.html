It does not depend on heating or moving air to transfer warmth.<p>

<p>Dometic's commercial grade roof a/c are performance-tested to get rid of severe or unusual roadway and weather conditions. Lots of standard systems break down after just four hours of severe vibration screening, while the Vigorous II is still going strong at 30 hours and more! The galvanized steel leading plate supplies lasting strength while long copper lines lessen vibration and, therefore, sound too. While being among the most difficult a/c around, its 410A refrigerant is kinder to the environment. Robust, lightweight and capable of performing in any environment! It won't let you down.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two should not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is used for producing power in the type of electrical power. The 2 operations utilize different processes, with geothermal energy needing water be heated up to boiling point to attain its aims.<p>
