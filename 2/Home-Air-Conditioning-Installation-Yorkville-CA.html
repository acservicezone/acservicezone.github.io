<h3>Furnace Repair in Yorkville CA</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various costs and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is truthful, trustworthy, and reasonable on cost. It's hard to find an honest AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
