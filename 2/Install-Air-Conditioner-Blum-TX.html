The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
