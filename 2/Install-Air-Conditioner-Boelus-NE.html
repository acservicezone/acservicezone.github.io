This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.
