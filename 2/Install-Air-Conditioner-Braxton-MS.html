<p>Though it may be tough to believe, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are infamous for decreasing the air quality in your home, however there are lots of other toxins that can not just filthy up the air, but cause other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and building materials contribute to bad air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unstable organic substances) from paint and even from some kinds of carpeting and upholstery products can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
