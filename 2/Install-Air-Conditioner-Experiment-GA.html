<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
