<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Irvine CA Home Owners</h3>
<p>Aspects that can contribute to the growth of biological contaminants are damp or damp building materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and improperly preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c unit. "Humidifier fever" is a common disease brought on by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Numerous fungis and germs grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these pollutants can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the structure occupants. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are animals and household plants.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
