<p>These men have been excellent. At a real estate agent, I often need contractors to offer me a viewpoint for what work on a house might cost. Recently I needed to get in touch with these guys twice. They came out quickly and offered me a no nonsense price quote for the work.

<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ might discover musty or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, talk to your physician about them. But not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for great building management.<p>
