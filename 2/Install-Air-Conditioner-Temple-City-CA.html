<h3>Air Conditioner Reviews in Temple City CA</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite HVACS on among the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out very same day to assess scenario & decided to opt for them for the work. I more than happy to say that not just did we get the central air conditioning going however likewise replaced the heating unit which was old. Everybody we talked with from beginning to end were very professional, courteous and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. A great location to begin is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Building Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification. Managers with BPI certification know that the home is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one aspect (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>
