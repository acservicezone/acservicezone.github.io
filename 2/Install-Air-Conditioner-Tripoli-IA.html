<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>

<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Tripoli IA</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant.

Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

Because you will have to hunt for alternative heating sources until the system is fixed, that's the last thing you desire.
