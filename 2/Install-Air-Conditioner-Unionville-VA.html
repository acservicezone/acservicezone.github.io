Too big and you'll run into issues with short-cycling, which can harm the ac system and shorten its life. Too small and your air conditioning system will not be able to cool your house appropriately.

Before inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to work until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
