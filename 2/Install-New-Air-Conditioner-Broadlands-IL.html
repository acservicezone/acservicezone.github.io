<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge pollutants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, often referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system air conditioning", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the walls, ceilings, or floors covered by grills) carry cooled air from the ac system to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it flows through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
