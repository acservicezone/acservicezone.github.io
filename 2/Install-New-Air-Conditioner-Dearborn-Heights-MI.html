<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Dearborn Heights MI</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
