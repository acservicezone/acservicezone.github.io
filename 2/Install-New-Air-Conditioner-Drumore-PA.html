<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it really rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job.

<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The primary factor house owners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending on the amount of services offered.

However, some manufacturers require routine maintenance as a regard to the warranty.<p>
