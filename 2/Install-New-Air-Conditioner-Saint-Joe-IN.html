<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as a Vital Organisation in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are ranked 90% performance or better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which may be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can imply significant cost savings in annual heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage heating systems increase efficiency even further by running at lower or greater capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioning unit and refrigerators employed combustible or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
