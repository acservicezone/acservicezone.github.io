<p>Air flow patterns in building are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural effects. Atmospheric pressure differences created by these forces move airborne pollutants from areas of higher pressure to locations of lower pressure through any available opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems.

<p>Homeowners may likewise presume that due to the fact that a glowing floor heating system can be viewed (and financed) as a home improvement, its installation will instantly raise their house's value. No evidence exists recommending that in-floor heating either positively or adversely impacts home values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the annual Cost vs. Value Report issued by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Remodeling Magazine. Maybe Realtors need to consider too many variables to definitively mention what a radiant heating system may add to, or subtract from, any given asking rate. That said, property buyers looking to go green," who focus on energy cost savings, or who absolutely desire an in-floor heater will be willing to pay a premium for a house that includes one.<p>
