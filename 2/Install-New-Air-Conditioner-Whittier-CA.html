<p>Remember, too, that you might want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump units can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a home heater, you might look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and efficiency. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to try to find a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winters. The good news is that the one major drawback of heat pumps is that they can fail in the incredibly hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
