Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
