<p>Enhance your services, make more services income, and supply a fantastic consumer experience. To make certain the system you pick is the best size for your house, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation estimate to identify the precise kind of heat and a/c system that's just right for your home-we do not just change it with the exact same size system you currently have. These calculations consider things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more.

By comparison, replacing a furnace and inspecting filter can generally be performed in simply a couple of minutes, typically with no tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, usually mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
