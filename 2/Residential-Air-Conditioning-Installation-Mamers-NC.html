<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Mamers NC</h3>
<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the cooling. I proceeded and bought this Carrier and I must say it gets the job done quite well. It takes very little time to warm up or cool off your house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had previously. The system hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Since an air conditioning system moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept clean. This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
