<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product over time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
