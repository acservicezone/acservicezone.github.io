<p>We look at ideas before we offer recommendations to replace instead of repair a heating unit. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher every year, we know the system is not running effectively. It might be in best condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older system.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>The predominant health result connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
