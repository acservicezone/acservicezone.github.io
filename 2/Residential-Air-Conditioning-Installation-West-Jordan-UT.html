Just as with switches, somebody may have turned off a gas valve and then forgotten to turn it back on. Trace the gas line back from the furnace to the meter, and if you see a manage that's perpendicular to the gas pipe, turn it so it's parallel. Gas furnace repair is depends upon how old your furnace is. You may have a pilot light if you have an old furnace or boiler.
