<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
