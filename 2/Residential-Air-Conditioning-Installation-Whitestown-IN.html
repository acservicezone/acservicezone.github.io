<p>Instantaneous discounts on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are available to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Outstanding Customer Service! Environment Pro is reliable and really cared about us and our circumstance. We got back one night to a cold house. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came by that exact same night.

<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in efficiency benefit since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Due to the fact that they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Because an unit is set up in each space or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
