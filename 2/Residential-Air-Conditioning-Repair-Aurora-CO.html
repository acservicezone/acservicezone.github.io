<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor wisely, much of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a reputable company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the same).

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to look out for. Initially, you need to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
