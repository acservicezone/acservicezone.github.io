<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very handy in gathering details on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to briefly manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
