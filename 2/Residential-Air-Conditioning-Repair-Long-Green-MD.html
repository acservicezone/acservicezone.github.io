<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
