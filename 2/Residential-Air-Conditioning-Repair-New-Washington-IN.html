<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the higher temperature levels in some cases utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to supply thermal convenience indoors. However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for mindful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities generate mold growth and wetness inside your home is connected with a greater frequency of occupant respiratory issues.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Guideline banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
