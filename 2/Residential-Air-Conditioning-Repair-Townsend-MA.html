<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood simply what the problem was and fixed it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
