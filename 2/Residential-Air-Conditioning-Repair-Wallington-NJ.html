<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
