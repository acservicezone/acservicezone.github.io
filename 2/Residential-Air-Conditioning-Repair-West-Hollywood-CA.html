<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heatpump work on electricity and work like air conditioning unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

<p>Since a project such as this is going to need a rather substantial quantity of work it is advised that a property owner request numerous estimates from a range of contractors. The very best times of the year to do such a task are in the months in which houses are not using their heating systems. This will usually enable the work to be completed rapidly and the house owner to get the best pricing available. It is also important to ensure that a contractor will go over the tax benefits of an upgrade to an effective heating system, and even help with paperwork and documents.<p>

Natural ventilation schemes can use extremely little energy, however care should be taken to make sure comfort. In damp or warm climates, maintaining thermal convenience entirely through natural ventilation might not be possible. A/c systems are used, either as backups or supplements. Air-side economizers also utilize outdoors air to condition spaces, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and disperse cool outside air when proper.<p>
