<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
