<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an uncommonly high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had called the service supervisor and left a message of concern.

Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year.
