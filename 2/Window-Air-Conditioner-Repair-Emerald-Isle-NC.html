<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as vital as a regular oil modification in your vehicle. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests changing your filter once every three months. Throughout high usage months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
