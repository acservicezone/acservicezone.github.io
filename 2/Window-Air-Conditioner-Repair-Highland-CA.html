<p>These principles-- and willingness to suffer through the heat-- may currently be changing. Though just 33 percent of Seattle housing systems had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 brand-new housing units have been integrated in the 4 years considering that or are presently under construction. The large majority of these systems are mixed-use or multi-family, where air conditioning is more of an industry requirement, states Scott Vollmoeller of engineering firm Glumac.<p>
<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the evaporator, compressor, and condenser are all situated in one cabinet, which generally is put on a roofing system or on a concrete slab beside your home's structure. This type of air conditioning system likewise is utilized in little commercial buildings. Air supply and return ducts originate from inside through the home's exterior wall or roofing system to connect with the packaged a/c, which is usually situated outdoors. Packaged air conditioners typically include electric heating coils or a gas furnace. This mix of air conditioning system and central heating unit removes the need for a separate furnace inside.<p>
<p>You could upgrade to the highest efficiency equipment readily available and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days.

Prior to deciding whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician ought to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air escapes the system.<p>
