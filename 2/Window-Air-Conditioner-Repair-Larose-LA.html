<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that may affect the health of individuals who live in the home. Contaminants might come from outside the house-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground listed below. An air pollutant might also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unstable organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or personal care items. Viruses and bacteria, pet dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Usually the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to reduce the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is likewise a more cost-effective method to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later in this section.<p>
