<p>Acknowledged as a leader in the HVAC industry, Bard Manufacturing combines quality products and outstanding service with innovation and technological advances to provide high-performance heating & cooling products worldwide. A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of several spaces with one external system.

<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the main problem.

The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>

<h3>Have Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Matthews NC</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on different home efficiency upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.)

<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run due to the fact that it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger system. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
