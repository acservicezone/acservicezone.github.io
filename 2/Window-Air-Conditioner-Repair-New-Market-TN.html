<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Do not position the condenser under a deck or totally confine it because it exhausts warm air out the top. Any air flow restriction will lower the system's efficiency. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that just an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to pricey compressor failure, but a homeowner doesn't have the abilities or tools essential to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and proper airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the needed equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician check the system occasionally.<p>
