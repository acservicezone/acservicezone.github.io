<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you should check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
