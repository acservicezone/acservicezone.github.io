<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product gradually. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
