While you can definitely acquire your furnace yourself, the majority of contractors won't service warranty the furnace or might not install it if you do not purchase it from them.

<p>The primary health result associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
