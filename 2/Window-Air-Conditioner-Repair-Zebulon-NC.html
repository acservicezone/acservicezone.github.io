<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Because it exhausts warm air out the top, don't position the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any airflow restriction will reduce the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that only a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, however a property owner doesn't have the abilities or tools required to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and proper air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, however house owners do not have the needed equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still needed to have a professional technician check the system periodically.<p>

The two operations use different processes, with geothermal energy needing water be warmed to boiling point to attain its goals.<p>
