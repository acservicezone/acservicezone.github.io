<p>Buy education and training: HVAC is not "rule of thumb" work, and no 2 houses are the same. When service technicians are effectively trained, they select and install effective, safe equipment. They understand what it suggests to supply superior craftsmanship, and they get less callbacks from disappointed customers. Supervisors and creators must also stay abreast of evolving technologies and industry best practices.<p>
