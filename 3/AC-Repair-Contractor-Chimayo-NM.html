<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is generally higher than numerous heatpump choices, they can still be highly efficient, depending on the design you purchase. Among the primary advantages of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperatures than other heating options. This indicates it can heat up your house to the desired temperature level quicker than a heatpump can.<p>

The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
