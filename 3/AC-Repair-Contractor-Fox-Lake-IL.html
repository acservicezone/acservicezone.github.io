<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required skills to do the job and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the unit has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
