Instead of an easy sales job, the owner of the company made a full evaluation of our heating system and situated methods we could have more even heat.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash can be found in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to use car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There need to not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
