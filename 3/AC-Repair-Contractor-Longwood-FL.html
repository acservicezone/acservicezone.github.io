<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
