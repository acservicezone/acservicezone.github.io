It's sort of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there haven't bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Structure Performance Institute (BPI) certification. Supervisors with BPI accreditation know that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as simply one element (out of lots of) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years earlier and know the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
