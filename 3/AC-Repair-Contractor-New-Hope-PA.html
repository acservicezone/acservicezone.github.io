<p>Expert heating unit setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC experts recommend following this fundamental rule when deciding whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
