<p>Picking the ideal size air conditioner is an essential part of the HVAC buying procedure and one that you'll need an HVAC expert to assist you with. Here's why purchasing the ideal size air conditioner matters: if you buy an HVAC system that's too huge, you'll end up wasting cash and energy. And if it's too little, you will not get warm or enough cool air to keep you comfy.<p>
<p>Air conditioners can create a great deal of water since they remove wetness from the air. To get rid of this, they have a normally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To deal with condensate problems, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, below.<p>
