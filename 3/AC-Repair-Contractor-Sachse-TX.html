Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step.

<h3>Assessing the Performance of Your HVAC System in Sachse TX</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating unit. We decided on getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy costs. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
