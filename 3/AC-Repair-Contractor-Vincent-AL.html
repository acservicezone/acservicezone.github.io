<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, work environments and houses matters, particularly considering that we invest most of our lives indoors. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in very damp climates or in cases where the air conditioning unit is large, it might not accomplish a low humidity.

<p>Another option to oil heating systems are gas heaters While oil is typically used in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have an option between the two types.
