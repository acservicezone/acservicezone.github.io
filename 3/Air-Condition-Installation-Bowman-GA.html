<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Installation in Bowman Georgia</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can shut and overheat down. You'll experience periodic durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them once again. Shut off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the air conditioning service still doesn't work correctly after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work fully unless you do this.<p>
<p>As a structure owner or facility manager, you need to consider the cost of unexpected downtime and the effect older, ineffective systems have on the bottom line.
