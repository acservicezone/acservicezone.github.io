<h3>Have Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Boyd TX</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even little window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
