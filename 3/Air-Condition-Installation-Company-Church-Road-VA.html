<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Image 6).<p>
