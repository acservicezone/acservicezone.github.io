<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as close to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to offer a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than devices set up simply a few years ago.<p>
