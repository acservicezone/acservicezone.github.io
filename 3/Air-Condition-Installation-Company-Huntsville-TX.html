Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
