<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
