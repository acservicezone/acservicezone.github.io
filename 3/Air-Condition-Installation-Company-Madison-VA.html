<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing at Madison VA</h3>
<p>Sean was really practical. He is a very enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

He made a few suggestions of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have performed in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale tactics used by some in the industry.<p>
