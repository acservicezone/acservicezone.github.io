When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
