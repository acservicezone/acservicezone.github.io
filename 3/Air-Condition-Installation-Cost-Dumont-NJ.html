<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually.
