<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon.
