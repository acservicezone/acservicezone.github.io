Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has actually been connected to symptoms like headaches, fatigue, problem concentrating, and inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.

<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  system rather of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Many factors affect IAQ. These aspects consist of bad ventilation (absence of outside air), issues controlling temperature level, low or high humidity, current remodeling, and other activities in or near a structure that can affect the fresh air coming into the structure. Sometimes, particular pollutants like dust from construction or restoration, mold, cleaning products, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (consisting of percentages of chemicals released as a gas gradually) may cause bad IAQ.<p>
