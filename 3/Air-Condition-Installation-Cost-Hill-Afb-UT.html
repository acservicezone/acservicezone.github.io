<p>The compressor can overheat and shut down if the condenser coils are blocked. You'll experience intermittent durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them once again. Turn off the power. Turn the cooling service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2).
