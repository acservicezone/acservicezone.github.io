<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the appropriate temperature level. Heaters that kick on frequently might be due to a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even an unclean burner.<p>
