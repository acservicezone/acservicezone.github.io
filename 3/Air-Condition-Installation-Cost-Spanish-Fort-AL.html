<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it could suck up to two times the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment set up just a few years back.<p>

<p>Elements that can add to the growth of biological pollutants are wet or damp building materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and inadequately maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c unit. "Humidifier fever" is a typical disease brought on by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Various fungis and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these pollutants can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the building occupants.

<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly minimizes exposure to toxins during cooking. Incorrect modification, frequently shown by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, causes increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue. If you buy a new gas range or range, think about purchasing one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot burner that burns continually. Never utilize a gas range to heat your home. Constantly ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in usage.<p>
