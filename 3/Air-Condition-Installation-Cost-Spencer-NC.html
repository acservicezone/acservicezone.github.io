<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements used for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be needed.<p>
<p>Generally the most reliable method to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate specific sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adapted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient method to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses.
