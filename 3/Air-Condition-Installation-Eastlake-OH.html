<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>A specific air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard ac system because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. Due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, since all parts of the dehumidifier are in the exact same room, no heat is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
