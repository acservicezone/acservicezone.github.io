<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside your home and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>

The 2 operations utilize various processes, with geothermal energy needing water be warmed to boiling point to achieve its aims.<p>
