<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
