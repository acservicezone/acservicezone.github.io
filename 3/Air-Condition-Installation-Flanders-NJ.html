<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the go to. They suggested changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was very delighted they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be utilizing them once again.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
