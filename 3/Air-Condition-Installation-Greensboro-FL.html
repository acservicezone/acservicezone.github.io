<p>G&S did an exceptional job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they detected the issue and fixed very quickly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals released as gases from processes or items; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a brand-new carpet is likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>Humid and wet conditions reproduce mold and mildew that can set off respiratory issues like allergies and asthma. Depending upon your place, the hot summer season can produce particularly humid conditions. Reduce the quantity of moisture in the air and curb the growth of irritating molds with a couple of well-placed dehumidifiers. There are a range of humidifier choices that will help preserve consistent humidity levels and produce comfy living conditions in your house.<p>
