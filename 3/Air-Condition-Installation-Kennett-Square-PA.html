<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
