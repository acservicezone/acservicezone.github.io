<p>A packaged system, usually set up on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, however it is likewise an alternative for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these units include not only the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost.

However, one con is that these systems are typically just readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity.
