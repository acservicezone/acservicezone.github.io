<p>A packaged system, usually set up on the roofing, is most commonly utilized on commercial structures, however it is likewise an alternative for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these units include not only the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system independently, because the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are typically just readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a great way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best alternative for house owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
