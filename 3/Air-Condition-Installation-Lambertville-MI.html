<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â The majority of furnaces have multiple control boards. The largest, or only one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t effectively diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when installed. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a professional to identify.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
