These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
