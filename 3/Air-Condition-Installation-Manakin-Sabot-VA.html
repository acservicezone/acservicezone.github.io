<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
