<p>In most cases, if products have actually stopped working to dry numerous days after the presumed water event, mold growth is suspected within wall cavities even if it is not right away noticeable.

Our tip to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to test the a/c unit prior to you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to check AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
