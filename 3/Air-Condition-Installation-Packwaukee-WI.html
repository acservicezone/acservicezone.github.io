Nevertheless, much of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not offer them.  Second of all like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found someone to properly service and the system has actually been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

<p>There is no simple response, however many use the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is most likely a much better solution.
