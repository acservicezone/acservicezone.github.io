<p>Before you go out and buy an air conditioning unit, there are a couple of things to choose first. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioner? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioning system be? Too large and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can harm the ac system and shorten its life. Too small and your air conditioning unit won't be able to cool the house correctly.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
