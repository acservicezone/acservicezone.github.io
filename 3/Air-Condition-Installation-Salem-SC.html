Purchased a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
