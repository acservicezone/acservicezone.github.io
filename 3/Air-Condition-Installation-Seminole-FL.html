<p>Geothermal heatpump are extremely efficient, since ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is always at a consistent temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just attain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). POLICE rates just how much heat a system removes or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling result.
