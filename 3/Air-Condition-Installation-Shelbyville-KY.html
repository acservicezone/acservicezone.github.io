<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the cost terrific however Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
