<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Due to the fact that it merely takes more electricity to run a larger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
