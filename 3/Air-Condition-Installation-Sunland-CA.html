When the a/c works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
