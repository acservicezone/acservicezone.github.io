<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might impact the health of people who reside in the home. Contaminants might come from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon going into your home from the ground listed below. An air toxin might also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or moist carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or individual care products.

EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
