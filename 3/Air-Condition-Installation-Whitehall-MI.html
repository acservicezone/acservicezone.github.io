<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as an Essential Business in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are rated 90% effectiveness or better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it really rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
