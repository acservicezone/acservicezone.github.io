<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Wildie KY</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung out fixing the problem, all the while discussing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
