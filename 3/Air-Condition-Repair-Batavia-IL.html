<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, offices and schools matters, particularly because we spend the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in very humid environments or in cases where the air conditioning system is oversized, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioner will require more energy to cool your home. A more suitable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>For example, contaminants might gather within the air diffusers and grills, presenting pollutants into the environment. Or if the outside air intake is located near a source of moisture or other outdoor contaminant, it may act as a path to carry the pollutants inside. Or the ventilation system may not be working along with it must-- if particles is obstructing the outside air intake, for example, or the filters are polluted or improperly preserved.<p>
