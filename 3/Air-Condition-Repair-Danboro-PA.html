If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's good airflow at the registers.
