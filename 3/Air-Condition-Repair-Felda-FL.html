<p>Most people do not understand how humidity is removed from your Houston Midtown Tx home. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic likewise acts a dehumidifier.

You'll have a water leak if your HVAC system is not draining pipes correctly. A constraint in your drainage pipelines causes a water leak. There are various places a clog can take place. Among the main locations where obstructions begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Make sure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
