<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ may notice unpleasant or musty smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak with your physician about them. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
