Dust and dander are notorious for decreasing the air quality in your house, however there are lots of other contaminants that can not only filthy up the air, but result in other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and building products add to bad air quality, and can likewise trigger cancers. VOCs (unpredictable natural compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpets and upholstery products can cause issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your home may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, search for indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can show your home might not have adequate ventilation include wetness condensation on windows or walls, stinky or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become moldy.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you need to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
