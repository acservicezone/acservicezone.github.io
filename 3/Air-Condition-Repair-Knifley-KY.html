<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
