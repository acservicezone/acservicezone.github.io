<p>Allergens are materials that trigger an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are mostly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can become air-borne, and therefore, are quickly breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline allergen could induce an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out troubleshooting the issue, all the while explaining whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
