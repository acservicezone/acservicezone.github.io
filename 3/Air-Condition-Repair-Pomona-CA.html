<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally caused by the absence of adequate ventilation, which results in a buildup of pollutants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined inadequate ventilation as the main problem in majority the office indoor air investigations it has performed. Investigations carried out in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually found the same to be true. These investigations revealed that appropriate ventilation is necessary in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The toxins noted in this guide have been revealed to trigger the health results discussed. However, it is not necessarily true that the results kept in mind happen at the pollutant concentration levels typically found in the home. In a lot of cases, our understanding of the toxins and their health results is too minimal to figure out the levels at which the listed results could happen.<p>
