Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
