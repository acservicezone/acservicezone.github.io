<p>The compressor can overheat and shut down if the condenser coils are blocked. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are tidy, tidy them again. Turn off the power. Flip the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the detach block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work correctly after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs.
