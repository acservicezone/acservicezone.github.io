<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Anderson AL</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make sure all the registers in your house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the issue.<p>
