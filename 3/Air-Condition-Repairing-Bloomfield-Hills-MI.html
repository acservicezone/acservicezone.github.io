<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes.
