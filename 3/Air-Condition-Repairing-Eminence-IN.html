<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on.

Prior to that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

While doing so, heat is absorbed from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
