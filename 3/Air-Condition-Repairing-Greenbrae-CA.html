<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a tough task that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps people working. When a sales guy concerns your house he exists to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and need to not "require" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I give you the alternatives for your needs and you choose if you require it.<p>
