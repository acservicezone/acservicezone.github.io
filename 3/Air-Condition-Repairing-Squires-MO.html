<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the performance and performance of your HVAC system, multiple studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor sensibly, many of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the very same).

She didn't require a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
