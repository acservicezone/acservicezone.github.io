<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the price great but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
