<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For example, humans breathe out co2, which in small amounts is not harmful, but might end up being harmful if high concentrations are allowed to build up. Micro-organisms or bacteria may also be present within the ventilation system. They may spread out throughout the whole work environment or building by methods of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
