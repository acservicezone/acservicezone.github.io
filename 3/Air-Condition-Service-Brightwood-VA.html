<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
