<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractor in Clarendon Hills</h2>

<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with regular preventive maintenance, however, there will always be the odd issue that periodically comes up. It is extremely essential that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible when you do see your furnace behaving strangely. The faster you respond to problems with your furnace, the much easier they are to repair. Waiting to require repairs will only make the issue even worse, and often more expensive.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
