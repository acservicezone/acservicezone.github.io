<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you ought to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
