<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Company in Darien</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, a lot of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
