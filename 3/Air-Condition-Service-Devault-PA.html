<p>They were fantastic! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested. They fulfilled my needs completely by providing a professional quote with alternatives, without pushing additional products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the essential inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>
<p>Integrity Energy fasted to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heaters were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced two furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday up until the brand-new heaters can heat your home. Truthfully, our home heating system is complicated, Rob and his team fixed the old duct, altered all the dampers, make the whole system work completely.<p>
<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
