<p>I am replacing our High Speed System since of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment maker's to guarantee your factory service warranties stay in location. Moreover, the tangible results of a PM is frequently hard to measure, as one action specified the savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not just break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the outcome of repetitive use of a component that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early degeneration, resulting in holes and fractures. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the part.  an extremely useful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
