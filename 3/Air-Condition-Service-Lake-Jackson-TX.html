Installing a multi-split system develops more difficulties, since a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
