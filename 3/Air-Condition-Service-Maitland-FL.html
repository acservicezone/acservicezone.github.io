<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
