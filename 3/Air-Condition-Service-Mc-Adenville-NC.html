<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>We have been using Keefe's for several years and have actually constantly been very satisfied. They provide outstanding repair set up and the client service is wonderful. We just recently had a concern with an older system and contacted us to set up a day and time to have it inspected. They sent out James Bell and he was great. He put in the time to describe our alternatives cost differences and was very well-informed expert and practical. Happy consumers. " Mathew Licausi.<p>
