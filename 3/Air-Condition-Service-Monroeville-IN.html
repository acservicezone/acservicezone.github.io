<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is usually higher than numerous heatpump choices, they can still be highly effective, depending upon the design you purchase. Among the primary advantages of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to greater temperatures than other heating choices. This suggests it can heat up your home to the desired temperature quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless toxic gas. Because it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you before you are aware it is in your house. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes mild impacts that are typically mistaken for the influenza. These symptoms include headaches, dizziness, tiredness, disorientation and queasiness. The effects of CO direct exposure can differ significantly from individual to person depending on age, general health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
