<p>Before you head out and buy an air conditioning system, there are a few things to choose first. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioning unit? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to install some or go ductless? How big should the a/c unit be? Too large and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning unit and reduce its life. Too little and your a/c won't be able to cool your house appropriately.

<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ may discover musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for good building management.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, frequently described as central air" or split-system cooling", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floors, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Learn how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
