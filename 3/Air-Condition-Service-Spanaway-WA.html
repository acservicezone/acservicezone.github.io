<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the amount of outside air coming indoors. A lot of house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioning system with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate.

A professional maintenance technician will flush and clean the condensate drain to guarantee all excess moisture flows away from the system.<p>
