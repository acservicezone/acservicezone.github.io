Green tasks accounted for 20 percent of all freshly constructed houses in the U.S. in 2015.

<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is updated every four years. The Principles Handbook consists of heating and cooling computations. The design professional should consult ASHRAE information for the standards of style and care as the typical building codes provide little to no information on HVAC design practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do consist of much detail on installation requirements, however. Other helpful reference materials include products from SMACNA, ACGIH, and technical trade journals.<p>
<p>Energy effectiveness can be improved even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems. Zones are managed by multiple thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is extremely vital to keeping a correct temperature.<p>
<p>Many HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that enable property owners to manage the temperature and set it on a schedule. For example, you can set the thermostat to decrease the heat when you're not in house to save money on the energy costs and make sure the system isn't overburdened. An expert technician will examine the thermostat during the annual maintenance to ensure the actual temperature and the temperature on the thermostat matches. The technician needs to check the thermostat's performance or assess the entire HVAC system if there's a difference in the temperature level.<p>
