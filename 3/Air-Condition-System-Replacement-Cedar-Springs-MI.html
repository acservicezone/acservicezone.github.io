<p>Professional heater setups. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually stop working. HVAC experts advise following this basic rule when deciding whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a new system, it's finest to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than needed.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, along with all other types of heatpump, have actually performances rated according to their coefficient of performance, or POLICE. It's a scientific way of figuring out how much energy the system moves versus how much it uses. Most geothermal heatpump systems have Polices of 3.0 to 5.0.
