<p>Since an ac system moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept clean. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>Next, and possibly just as essential when it pertains to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, however will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to effectively cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Often a short-term indoor air quality problem is produced just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded conference location. In those cases, a short-term repair may be all that's required, such as bringing or opening a window in a fan. But more complex problems-- determined by regularly inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the problem you're experiencing, among the 3 techniques below may be proper.<p>
