<p>We needed 2 visits - Jake came out first and was pleasant and extremely knowledgeable and courteous. Grant came out a couple days later on and was likewise educated and good to talk to. They both did a terrific task. Sabre's workplace personnel is very useful, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and providing the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are likewise well priced for their services. Definitely suggest.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
