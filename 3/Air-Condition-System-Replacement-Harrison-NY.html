<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the a/c. I went on and purchased this Carrier and I need to say it gets the job done rather well. It takes very little time to heat up or cool down your house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t obtain from the one we had in the past. The unit hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
