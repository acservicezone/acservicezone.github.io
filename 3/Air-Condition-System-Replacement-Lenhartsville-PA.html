<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house.

It also avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
