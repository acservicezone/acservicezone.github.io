<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging product to safeguard it from damage.

<p>A/c unit manufacturers normally make rugged, high quality items. Begin by examining any merges or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the unit cool down for about 5 minutes prior to resetting any breakers.

<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his examination, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a tube twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house.

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
