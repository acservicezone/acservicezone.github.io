<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of visible development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Dripping return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Southaven MS?</h3>

The 2 operations use different processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to accomplish its aims.<p>
