<h3>HVAC Supply in Turners Station KY</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
