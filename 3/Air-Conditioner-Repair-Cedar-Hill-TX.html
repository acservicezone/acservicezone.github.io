<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a recommendation later). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
