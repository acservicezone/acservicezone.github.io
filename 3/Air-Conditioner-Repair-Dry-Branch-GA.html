<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit need relatively little attention. But, similar to any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is vital to keep the system working smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater resemble those of standard hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank ought to be checked for leakages, the system ought to be flushed regularly to remove tank and gathered impurities (scaling in tough water locations).

Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home.

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
