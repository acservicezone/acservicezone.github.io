Location the air conditioning system back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season.

<p>My eldest child always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I realized that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think about anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
