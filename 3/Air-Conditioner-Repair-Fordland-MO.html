<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>A/c can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space.

Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
