<p>Indoor pollutants. These include chemicals used in the building or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops must be used with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances must be sealed and power-vented systems installed to eliminate items of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also develop particulates and must be vented outside.<p>
