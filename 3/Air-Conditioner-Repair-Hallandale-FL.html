<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

If you've installed the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature listed below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
