<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really consume no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth.

<p>Selecting the right size air conditioning unit is an essential part of the HVAC buying procedure and one that you'll require an HVAC professional to help you with.

<p>A specific air conditioning unit that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard a/c in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the same air path.

Nevertheless, given that all parts of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat is removed. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heater that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
