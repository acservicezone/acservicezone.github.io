<h3>Furnace Company in Lexington AL</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency security switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace.

<p>The bureau jobs 34 percent work development for HVAC professionals in between 2010 and 2020, more than twice the average for all occupations.
