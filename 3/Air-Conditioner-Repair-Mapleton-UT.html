<p>Air conditioning system can create a great deal of water due to the fact that they remove wetness from the air. To get rid of this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area.
