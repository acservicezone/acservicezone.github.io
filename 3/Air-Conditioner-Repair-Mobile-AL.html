However, a lot of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Incorrectly located outside air consumption vents can also generate air polluted with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological contaminants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning system, or the inside surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>
