<p>Instantaneous discounts on high-efficiency heat pump innovations are available to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Exceptional Customer Care! Climate Pro is reputable and really cared about us and our situation. We came home one evening to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came by that exact same night. Although he didn't have actually the required replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he might look for and acquire it the next morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was absolutely thankful to have a heated home again. What's most remarkable was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to assist us right prior to a holiday, however Environment Pro came through for us. I will gladly advise this company to my buddies.<p>

<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System since of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Provider, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
