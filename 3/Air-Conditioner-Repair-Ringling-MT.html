<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
