<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating devices can last for years. But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel costs all of a sudden appear higher than typical, it is probably time to think about a brand-new system. New heating equipment is much more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel costs right now, not to mention the money you'll save money on repair costs. If your heating system is 25 years old or more, you can most likely expect to cut your fuel bills in half.<p>

The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.
