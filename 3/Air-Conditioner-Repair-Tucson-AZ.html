<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming indoors. Many home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of pollutants straight from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
