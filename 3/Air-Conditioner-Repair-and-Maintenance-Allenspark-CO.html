<h3>Maximizing the Performance of Your HVAC System in Allenspark CO</h3>
<p>Call Miller's Cooling & Heating at (925) 447-3000 and always talk with a valuable and live member of our team, who will immediately concentrate on your requirements. While our competitors punch a strict time clock, we recognize heating and cooling challenges typically arise beyond routine organisation hours. Rather than leave a message on a device, benefit from individualized service and the prompt action of radio dispatched trucks.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
