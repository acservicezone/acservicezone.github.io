<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
