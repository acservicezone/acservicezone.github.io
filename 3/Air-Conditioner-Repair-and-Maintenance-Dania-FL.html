<p>Structures are designed or intended to respond actively to some of these modifications in and around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sterilize, and keep surfaces to enhance their longevity, appearance, or efficiency. In other cases, such modifications subtly or perhaps drastically modify buildings in ways that may be essential to their own integrity or their effect on building residents through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time. We might discover it useful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the life sciences and, especially, a few of the approaches utilized by researchers studying ecosystems, in order to get an improved understanding of the environments in which we invest the majority of our time, our structures.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, since it is protected indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot over time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
