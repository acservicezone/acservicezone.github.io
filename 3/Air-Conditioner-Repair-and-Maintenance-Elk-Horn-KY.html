<p>Stability Energy fasted to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heating systems were not working. They appeared the next day and changed two furnaces and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the brand-new furnaces can heat the house.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
