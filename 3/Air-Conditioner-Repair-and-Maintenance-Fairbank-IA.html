You can usually conclude that the capacitor has actually failed.

However the possibilities are great that this may work for one cycle, however the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>

I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
