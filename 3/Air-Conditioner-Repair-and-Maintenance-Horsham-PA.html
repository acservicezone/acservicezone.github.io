<p>I have been using them for several years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to get in touch with guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the issue. He is truthful, trusted, and affordable on cost. It's tough to discover an honest AC guy and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>

<p>The split system is the most common. Many people are used to seeing this key in the yards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the components are housed in a metal box beyond the home. However, there are some internal components too. Split systems are perfect for cooling numerous spaces at once, but are not very energy effective. For that reason, one pro is not having loud devices in the house. At the exact same time, the con would be that those who utilize this may spend more cash on cooling expenses in the long run since of the lower energy efficiency.<p>
