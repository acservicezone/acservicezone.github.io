<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer auto debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
