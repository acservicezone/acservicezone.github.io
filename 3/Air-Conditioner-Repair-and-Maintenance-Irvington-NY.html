<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has actually ended up being a crucial concern to homeowners and health professionals. Indoor air contamination research studies have actually determined a number of impurities that can be present in indoor air. These include combustion items, unstable natural substances (including formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Correct ventilation and elimination of the sources of these impurities are essential in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking devices will send out the sensor data to the cloud, where you can access it by means of software.
