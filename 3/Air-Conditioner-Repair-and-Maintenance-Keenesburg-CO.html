<h3>Facts All Keenesburg CO Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>For entire home setups, it's difficult, if almost impossible, to retrofit a radiant heat system in an existing home, especially a hydronic system. Localized glowing floor heat systems to be utilized in one or a number of rooms like bathrooms, kitchen areas or laundry rooms are quickly renovated with electric radiant flooring heat. This is much more affordable on a smaller sized scale. Larger renovations like additions to a home might appropriate for a bigger scale and more pricey hydronic system.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
