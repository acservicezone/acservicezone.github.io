<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
