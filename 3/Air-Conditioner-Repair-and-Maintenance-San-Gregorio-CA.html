<p>Fact: Federal and local rewards normally total up to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the preliminary price of a system competitive with conventional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, throughout new construction (houses usually utilize in between one and 5 heaps). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot.

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensors: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it closes down rapidly. This is a really typical repair.

<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
