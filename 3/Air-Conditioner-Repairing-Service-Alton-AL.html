PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioner into a heatpump While room air conditioning supplies optimum versatility, when utilized to cool numerous spaces at a time it is generally more expensive than central air.<p>
