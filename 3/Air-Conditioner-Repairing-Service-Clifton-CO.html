Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<h3>HVAC Repair in Clifton Colorado</h3>

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it could grovel twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's because it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed just a couple of years earlier.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
