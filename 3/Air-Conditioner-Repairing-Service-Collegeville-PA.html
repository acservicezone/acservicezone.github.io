If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square video footage alone, transfer to another contractor.

This might be through a public offering, a sale to a large organisation in the field, and even a sale to another PE company. CoolSys is an HVAC contractor owned by PE firm Ares Management.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
