<p>Making use of air filters can trap a few of the air toxins. The Department of Energy's Energy Effectiveness and Renewable resource section suggests that "Air Filtration must have a Minimum Performance Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are utilized to lower the quantity of dust that reaches the wet coils. Dust can serve as food to grow molds on the damp coils and ducts and can minimize the efficiency of the coils.<p>
