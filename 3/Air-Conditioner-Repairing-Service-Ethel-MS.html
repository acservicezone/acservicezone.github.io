<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning a business was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't the end goal.

During high usage months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>
