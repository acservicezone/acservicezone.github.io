<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential buildings has become a crucial issue to property owners and health experts. Indoor air pollution research studies have actually recognized several contaminants that can be present in indoor air. These consist of combustion items, unpredictable organic substances (including formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Appropriate ventilation and elimination of the sources of these pollutants are essential in keeping good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality monitoring equipment will send the sensing unit information to the cloud, where you can access it through software. You get immediate, real-time access to the monitoring results through a dashboard, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to decipher.<p>
