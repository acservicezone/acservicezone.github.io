In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas furnaces, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops need to be utilized with fans that send out exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating devices should be sealed and power-vented systems set up to get rid of products of incomplete combustion.
