<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
