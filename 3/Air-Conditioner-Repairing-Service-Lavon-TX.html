This step is essential so the unit isn't too large-both or too little waste energy.<p>
<p>For example, problems develop when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in sufficient amounts of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation also happens if the air supply and return vents within each space are obstructed or positioned in such a method that outdoor air does not actually reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Incorrectly located outdoor air intake vents can likewise bring in air polluted with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological pollutants that have increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system.
