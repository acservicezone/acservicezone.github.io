<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't position the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it because it tires warm air out the top. Any airflow constraint will decrease the system's effectiveness. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>Indoor air pollution comes from a variety of sources; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined building materials, furnishings, and mold as major issues, but much of the threat likewise originates from burning things. For instance, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can create pollution in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly big problem in the developing world.<p>
<p>Heating is likewise one of the greatest energy customers in your house, so house owners who might be buying a new furnace must thinking about changing it with a more recent, more energy-efficient design to conserve money and help the environment. The average furnace lasts in between 15 and 20 years, so you're making a considerable investment in your home. Spend sensibly by learning as much as you can about readily available options.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For instance, humans breathe out co2, which in small amounts is not harmful, but might end up being hazardous if high concentrations are allowed to build up. Germs or micro-organisms may likewise be present within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do establish, they might spread out throughout the entire workplace or structure by means of the ventilation system.<p>
