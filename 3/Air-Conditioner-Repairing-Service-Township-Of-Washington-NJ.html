<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
