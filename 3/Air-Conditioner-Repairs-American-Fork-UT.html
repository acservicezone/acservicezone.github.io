<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, however it is also an option for property owners to think about. Oftentimes, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those looking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system individually, since the system is combined.
