<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide should be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements utilized for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be needed.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your home that best temperature throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those typical air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can cause expensive repairs down the roadway.

There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
