<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the possible to negatively impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and extremely small particles of dust.

For instance, he may seal gaps and cracks in the external walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs. Insulation may be a more efficient solution to your cooling issues than changing your devices.<p>
