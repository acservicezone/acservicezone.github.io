<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem.

The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
