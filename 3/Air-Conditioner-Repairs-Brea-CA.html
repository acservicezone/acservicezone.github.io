<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The goal is to supply sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
