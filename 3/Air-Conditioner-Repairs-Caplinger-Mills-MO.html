<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
