<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heatpump, whatever needs to be replaced eventually. As devices ages, it becomes less efficient. Central air systems and heatpump typically last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last approximately 20 years. If your system is near, or past, its anticipated life-span, replacement may be the most cost-effective option.<p>
