<p>Poor indoor air quality is generally caused by the lack of appropriate ventilation, which results in a buildup of pollutants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified inadequate ventilation as the main problem in majority the work environment indoor air examinations it has performed. Investigations carried out in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the same to be true. These examinations revealed that correct ventilation is very important in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Since the 1980s, producers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they produce more efficient. This was originally driven by increasing energy costs, and has more just recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental concerns. Additionally, enhancements to the HVAC system efficiency can likewise help increase resident health and efficiency. 21 In the United States, the EPA has enforced tighter limitations throughout the years. There are numerous techniques for making HVAC systems more efficient.<p>
<p>The most common type of home heater in the U.S. burns gas or gas to produce heat. With an average cost that varies from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least costly choice, but newer systems can be very energy effective.

A persistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heating system is in usage, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
