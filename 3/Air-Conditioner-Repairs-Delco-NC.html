<h3>Gas Central Heating in Delco NC</h3>
<p>If you set it too low, you're motivating the development of mold in damp air. The heat dries out the air, preventing mold development and pollution. Naturally, too-dry air can also aggravate your sinuses and lungs, while too much indoor humidity can add to the growth of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
