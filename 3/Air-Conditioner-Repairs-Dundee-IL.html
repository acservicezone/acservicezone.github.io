<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year.

<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
