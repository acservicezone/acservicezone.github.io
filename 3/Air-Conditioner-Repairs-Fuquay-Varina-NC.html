<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

The outside condenser system likewise switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
