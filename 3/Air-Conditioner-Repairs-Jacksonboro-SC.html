<p>Central air conditioning conditioners are more efficient than space a/c. In addition, they are out of the way, quiet, and convenient to run. To conserve energy and money, you ought to shop an energy-efficient air conditioner and minimize your central air conditioning conditioner's energy usage.

<p>The reality is, air pollution in your home can be simply as bad - or even worse - than it is outdoors.
