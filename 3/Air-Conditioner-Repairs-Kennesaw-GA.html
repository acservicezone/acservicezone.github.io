<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest will not begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that secure your cooling system from flooding. Among the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is an excellent possibility; you may have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen.
