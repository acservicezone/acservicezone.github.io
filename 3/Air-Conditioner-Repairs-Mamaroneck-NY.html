<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Mamaroneck NY</h3>
<p>Whether it's the middle of winter season or summer season, having a working HVAC system is essential. At Lowe's, we have a variety of heating and cooling systems-- from furnaces and heat pumps to window air conditioning unit and portable air conditioning unit Plus, we provide cooling installation and heating installation by licensed expert independent installers.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
