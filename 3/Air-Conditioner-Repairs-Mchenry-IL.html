<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heaters are still widely used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

The radiators might be installed on walls or installed within the flooring to produce flooring heat.<p>
