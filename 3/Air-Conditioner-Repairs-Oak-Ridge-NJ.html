<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
