<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling.

<p>Room air conditioning system feature a thermostat sensor, located behind the control panel, which determines the temperature level of air entering the evaporative coil. If the sensor is knocked out of position, the a/c unit might cycle constantly or act erratically.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge toxins.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
