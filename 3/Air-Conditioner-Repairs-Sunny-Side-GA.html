<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).

<h3>Air Condition Service Near me in Sunny Side GA</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
