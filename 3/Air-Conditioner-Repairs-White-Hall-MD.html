<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in White Hall Maryland</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have 2 major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Another option to oil furnaces are gas heating systems While oil is typically used in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have an option between the 2 types. Gas heating systems cost about the same, approximately $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The genuine advantage of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas expenses around $540 a year, rather than the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
