<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also regulating the temperature of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. The majority of people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the space they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold areas", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot next to the radiators. This generally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Radiant heat supplies warmth from the flooring up throughout the room with no cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>
