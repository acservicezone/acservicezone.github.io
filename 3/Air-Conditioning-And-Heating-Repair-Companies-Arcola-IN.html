<p>Air conditioning system makers usually make rugged, high quality items. Start by checking any merges or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
