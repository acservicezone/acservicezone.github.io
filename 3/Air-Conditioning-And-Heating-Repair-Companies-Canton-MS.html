<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but your house does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
