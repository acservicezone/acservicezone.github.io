<h3>Ductless Heating And Cooling in Culver IN</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
