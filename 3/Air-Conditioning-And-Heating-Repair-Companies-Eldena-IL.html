<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, many of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.
