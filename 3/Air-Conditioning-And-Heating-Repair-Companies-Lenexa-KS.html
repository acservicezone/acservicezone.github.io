<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Air toxins can vary from pollutants generated from the outdoors by your family pets to dangerous gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a common air toxin arising from natural gas that escapes into your home without being burned off.

In kitchens and restrooms, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where wetness levels are generally greater than in the rest of your home.<p>

If one or more of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
