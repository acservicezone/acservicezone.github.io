<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off totally.<p>

<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. As soon as the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively harden and cure-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
