After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
