<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
