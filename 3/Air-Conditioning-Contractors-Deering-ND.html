I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental house. He assisted me difficulty shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is sincere, reputable, and affordable on price. It's tough to find a truthful AC person and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
