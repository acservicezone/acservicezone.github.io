<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as vital as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. Energy Star advises changing your filter once every 3 months. During high use months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>

<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise homes bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually watched the single-family house installation service totally flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter season used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not just with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are finally giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in vehicles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by certified HVAC technicians. For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by many individuals.<p>

Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
