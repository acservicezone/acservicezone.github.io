<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

If your house is not heating up, only be concerned. However, if your system does not seem working correctly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice.
