Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them up until they have been properly dried. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent visits, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
