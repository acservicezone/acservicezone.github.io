<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more tough to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
