<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
