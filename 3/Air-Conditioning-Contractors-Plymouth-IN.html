<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller home, which will impact installation costs. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All things in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the radiant heat system has been running for a while, consisting of individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts which sudden shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>
