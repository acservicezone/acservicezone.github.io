<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
