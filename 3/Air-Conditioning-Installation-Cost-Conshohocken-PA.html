Initially, use exterior-grade pushed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinets, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, think about utilizing solid wood items. Secondly, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, ensure that an effective moisture barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet.
