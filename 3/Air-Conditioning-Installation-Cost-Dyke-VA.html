<p>Indoor air pollution comes from a range of sources; the US Epa (EPA) has recognized building products, home furnishings, and mold as serious concerns, but much of the danger likewise comes from burning things.

This is an especially big issue in the establishing world.<p>
<p>A third way to choose whether your house may have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination.

Indications that can indicate your house might not have enough ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or smelly air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other products become musty. To identify smells in your house, action outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether smells are obvious.<p>

While an area heating system is in usage, open a door from the room where the heating system is located to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
