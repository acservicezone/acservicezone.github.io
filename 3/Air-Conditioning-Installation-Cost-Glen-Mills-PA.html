<h3>Truth About Glen Mills PA Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing trend in home building is to lower air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofs, floors, and walls. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
