<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Middletown DE Home</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heater.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
