More recent gas boilers should accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
