<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price great however Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
