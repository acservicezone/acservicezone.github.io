<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is unblocked and dry.<p>

Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is generally greater than numerous heat pump alternatives, they can still be extremely efficient, depending on the model you purchase.

<p>Consider potential impacts of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating unit. Follow the producer's instructions, particularly guidelines on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit properly adjusted.
