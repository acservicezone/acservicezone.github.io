<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
<p>G&S did an exceptional task installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The very best feature of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Makers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they detected the problem and fixed very rapidly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>When discussing alternatives for HVAC replacement, Bryant air conditioning brand name is another terrific brand name that requires to be thought about. Bryant is a well recognized brand that uses AC units, heatpump, and gas furnaces. It is fairly priced and is a sister company to a few of the other leading brand names on our list. Bryant air conditioning unit are frequently made with the same quality parts as a Carrier brand name HVAC system. It would cost around $2,624 in installation expenses if you were wanting to install a mid tier AC replacement with a 14 SEER Bryant Preferred 124ANS air conditioner.<p>
<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is typically essential to figuring out the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such info can in some cases be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If monitoring information is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent need to ask for that the employer have air tracking tests carried out. Evaluation of this data might identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on data might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
