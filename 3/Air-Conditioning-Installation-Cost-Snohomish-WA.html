<p>Seattle heating systems can run 9 months of the year. Based upon the average temperatures in our area, if you compared running your furnace to a car it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected life expectancy of 15 years.

<p>We look at ideas prior to we offer advice to replace rather than repair a heating unit. Among the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are greater every year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective design, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
