<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Occupational exposure limitations utilize dose-response information which show the health effects of repetitive exposure to one specific chemical.

<p>The most dangerous asbestos fibers are too little to be noticeable. After they are inhaled, they can remain and accumulate in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be deadly). Symptoms of these illness do not show up until several years after direct exposure began. Most people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to raised concentrations on the task; some developed illness from exposure to clothes and devices brought house from job sites.<p>
