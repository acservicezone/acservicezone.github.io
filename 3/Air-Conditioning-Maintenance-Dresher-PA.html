<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Unstable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
