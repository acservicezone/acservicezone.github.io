<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold.

Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>People who are allergic to these pollutants need to use allergen-proof bed mattress encasements, wash bedding in hot (130 degrees farenheit) water, and prevent space home furnishings that collect dust, particularly if they can not be washed in hot water.
