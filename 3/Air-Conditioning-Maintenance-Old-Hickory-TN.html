<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
