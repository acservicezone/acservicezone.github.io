<p>Unstable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals released as gases from processes or products; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from improperly placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might get in nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
