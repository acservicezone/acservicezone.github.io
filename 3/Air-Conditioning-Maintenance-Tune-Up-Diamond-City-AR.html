This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to regularly clean up the condenser coil.

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
