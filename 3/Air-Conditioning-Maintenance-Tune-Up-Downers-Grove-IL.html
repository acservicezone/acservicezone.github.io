<p>Heat pumps are a dream become a reality for folks in Seattle. A/c is something that most Seattleites will just use sparingly, however since heatpump can provide both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the best of both worlds! Not just are heat pumps hassle-free, they are incredibly energy efficient, too. If a heat pump remains in your future, the very best time to install cooling in your home may very well be when your heating system breaks down.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release toxins.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit, consider possible impacts of indoor air contamination. Follow the manufacturer's directions, particularly guidelines on the proper fuel and keeping the heating system effectively adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is typically a sign of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heating unit remains in usage, open a door from the space where the heating system is located to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
