<p>SysTech Style focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house.

It also avoids water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

The germs forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, including chlorine. Removal for Legionella outbreaks in commercial structures vary, but often consist of really warm water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and in many cases flushes of heavy metal salts.
