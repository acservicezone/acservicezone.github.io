<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your a/c is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Merely including refrigerant is not an option if it leakages. A skilled technician must fix any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the appropriate amount of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the efficiency and effectiveness of your air conditioning system is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's requirements, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be damaging to the environment.<p>
