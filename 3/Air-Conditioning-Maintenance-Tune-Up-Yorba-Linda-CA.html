<p>There are many sources of indoor air pollution in any house. These include combustion sources such as oil, gas, kerosene, wood, tobacco, and coal items; building products and furnishings as varied as shabby, asbestos-containing insulation, wet or moist carpet, and kitchen cabinetry or furnishings made from specific pressed wood items; products for home cleaning and maintenance, individual care, or hobbies; central heating and cooling systems and humidification devices; and outdoor sources such as radon, pesticides, and outdoor air pollution.<p>
<p>Energy effectiveness can be improved even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by several thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is very vital to maintaining a proper temperature.<p>
<p>A geothermal desuperheater is useful and extremely effective, especially throughout the Summer season while the system acts to cool one's home.

Additionally, during winter, the heat from underground can be absorbed to heat domestic water alongside its main purpose of offering area heating. This suggests that cost savings are still realized throughout the cooler period. In reality, a desuperheater decreases winter season water heating costs by around half.<p>
