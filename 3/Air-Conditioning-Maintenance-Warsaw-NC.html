<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top, do not put the condenser under a deck or totally confine it. Any air flow limitation will decrease the system's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, considering that it is secured inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to set up.

In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
