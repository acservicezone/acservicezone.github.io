<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the go to. They advised changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a fast web search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the new part.

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it could grovel twice the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use.

Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER.
