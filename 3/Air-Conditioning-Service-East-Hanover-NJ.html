<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
