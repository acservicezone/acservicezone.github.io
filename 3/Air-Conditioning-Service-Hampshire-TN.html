<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these homes were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system.

When the air conditioning system works however your home does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
