<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the higher temperature levels in some cases utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to supply thermal convenience inside. However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities generate mold development and wetness inside your home is associated with a higher frequency of resident breathing issues.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works but your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
