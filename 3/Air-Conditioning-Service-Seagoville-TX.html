<p>Last week, Target informed press reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the preliminary intrusion into its systems was traced back to network credentials that were taken from a 3rd party supplier. Sources now tell KrebsOnSecurity that the supplier in concern was a refrigeration, heating and air  conditioning subcontractor that has actually worked at a number of places at Target and other top retailers.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
