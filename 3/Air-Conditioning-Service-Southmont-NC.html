<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on.
