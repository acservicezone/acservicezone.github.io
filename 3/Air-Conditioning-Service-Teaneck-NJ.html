<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to assist keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your home at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot home will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller home, which will impact installation costs. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other elements that can impact this might be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in performance advantage due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leakages in your ducts. Since they don't require any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Since an unit is installed in each room or location you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>

Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
