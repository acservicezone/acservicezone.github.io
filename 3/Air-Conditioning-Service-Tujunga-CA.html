<h3>Check Out Ductwork At Tujunga CA Commercial Buildings</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on numerous house effectiveness upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took adequate time to assist us debate which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest savings. We never ever felt hurried and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's product and services was outstanding. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to carry out the needed electrical enhancements to save on cost.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
