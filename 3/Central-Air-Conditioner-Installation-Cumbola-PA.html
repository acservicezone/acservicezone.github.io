<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ may discover moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse, talk to your medical professional about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly put or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which may get in close-by ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
