<p>The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends upon a number of elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 essential impacts. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a pollutant depends upon specific level of sensitivity, which varies enormously from individual to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants as well.<p>
<p>Irritants are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can become airborne, and therefore, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of individuals with asthma, the existence of feline irritant could bring on an asthma attack in people with cat allergic reactions, however not in those individuals who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
