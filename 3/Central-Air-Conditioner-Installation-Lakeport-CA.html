<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Lakeport California</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>

Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER.

<p>I am really satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years earlier and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
