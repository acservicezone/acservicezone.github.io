<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, the majority of Midtown Houston Tx clients don't understand why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's more than likely your problem. If you discovered that your conditioning filter requires changing, then the next step is to defrost your air conditioning equipment. The simplest method to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
