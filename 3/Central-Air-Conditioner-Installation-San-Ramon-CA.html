<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
