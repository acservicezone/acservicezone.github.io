<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.
