<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is frequently essential to identifying the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such information can often be gotten by requesting copies of air tracking information from the company. If keeping an eye on data is not available, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union representative must request that the employer have air tracking tests conducted. Review of this information may recognize possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are really low, monitoring data might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
