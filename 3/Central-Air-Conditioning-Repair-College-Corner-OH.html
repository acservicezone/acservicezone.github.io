<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roof, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, however it is likewise an option for property owners to consider. Many times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are great for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system separately, considering that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these systems are normally only available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity.

For that reason, this may not be the very best option for house owners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
