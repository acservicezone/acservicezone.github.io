It safeguards the environment from harmful digging, fracking, or toxins since the energy utilized to heat your home is extracted directly from the ground.

While geothermal systems do use some electrical energy, they launch far fewer greenhouse gases or other toxins than heater that need gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions.

The normal set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
