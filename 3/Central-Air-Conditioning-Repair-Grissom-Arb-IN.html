<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Just like homes, the most essential factor affecting indoor air quality is the presence of toxin sources. Commonly discovered office contaminants and their sources. consist of environmental tobacco smoke; asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant structure supplies; formaldehyde from pressed wood products; other organics from building materials, carpet, and other workplace furnishings, cleaning activities and products, washroom air fresheners, paints, adhesives, photocopier, and photography and print shops; biological contaminants from dirty ventilation systems or water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management practices.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a routine oil modification in your automobile. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter better traps contaminants and debris in the air. Energy Star advises changing your filter as soon as every 3 months. Throughout high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
