<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a business was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>
<p>Because they get rid of wetness from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have an usually plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler.

Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the location. To handle condensate issues, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>
