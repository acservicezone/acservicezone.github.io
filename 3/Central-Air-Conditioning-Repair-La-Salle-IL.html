Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts which abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>
