<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
