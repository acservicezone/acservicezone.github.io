<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than commercial or outside settings. In jobs where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC unit, and installing the ductwork in the building. It may likewise include the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to specific areas.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heatpump, whatever needs to be replaced eventually. As equipment ages, it ends up being less efficient. Central air systems and heat pumps generally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last up to 20 years. If your system is near, or past, its expected life expectancy, replacement might be the most cost-efficient solution.<p>
