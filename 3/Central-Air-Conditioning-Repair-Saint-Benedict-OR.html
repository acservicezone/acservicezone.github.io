<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that only a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the abilities or tools essential to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the required devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely intricate and building occupants may be exposed to a range of impurities (in the form of gases and particles) from office devices, cleaning items, building and construction furnishings, carpets and activities, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), bugs, and outdoor pollutants. Other aspects such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how individuals respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
