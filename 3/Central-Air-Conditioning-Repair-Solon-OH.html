<p>It is especially important to take as much of these actions as possible while you are associated with short-term activities that can produce high levels of pollutants-for example, painting, paint removing, heating with kerosene heating units, cooking, or participating in maintenance and pastime activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding. You might likewise pick to do a few of these activities outdoors, if you can and if weather permits.<p>

A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.
