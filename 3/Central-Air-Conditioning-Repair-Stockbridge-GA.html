<p>Property owners might also assume that due to the fact that a radiant flooring heating system can be viewed (and funded) as a house improvement, its installation will instantly raise their home's value. No evidence exists suggesting that in-floor heating either positively or negatively affects property worths. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the yearly Cost vs. Value Report issued by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Improvement Publication. Perhaps Real estate agents need to think about a lot of variables to definitively specify what a radiant heating system might contribute to, or deduct from, any given asking cost. That said, homebuyers wanting to go green," who focus on energy savings, or who definitely want an in-floor heating unit will want to pay a premium for a house that includes one.<p>
