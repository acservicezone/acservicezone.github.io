<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heater, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
