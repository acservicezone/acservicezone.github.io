An alternative to packaged systems is making use of separate indoor and outdoor coils in split systems Split systems are preferred and extensively utilized worldwide other than in North America. In The United States and Canada, divided systems are usually seen in residential applications, however they are acquiring popularity in small commercial structures. The split systems are a terrific choice for small buildings where ductwork is not practical or where the space conditioning performance is of prime concern. 19 The advantages of ductless cooling systems include easy installation, no ductwork, higher zonal control, flexibility of control and quiet operation. citation required In space conditioning, the duct losses can represent 30% of energy usage. 20 The use of minisplit can result in energy cost savings in space conditioning as there are no losses associated with ducting.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a range of various heater, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
