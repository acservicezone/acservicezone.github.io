<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
