<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Midway Park NC</h3>

For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by numerous individuals.<p>
