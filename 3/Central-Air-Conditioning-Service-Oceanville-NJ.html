<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. First, you must inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
