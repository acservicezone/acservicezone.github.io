<p>While toxin levels from specific sources might not pose a substantial health risk on their own, most houses have more than one source that adds to indoor air pollution. There can be a major risk from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Thankfully, there are actions that most people can take both to reduce the risk from existing sources and to prevent brand-new problems from occurring. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to assist you choose whether to take actions that can minimize the level of indoor air contamination in your own house.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>Aside from space heating, the geothermal heater can also be linked to a device called a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat generated from the ground source heatpump compressor and utilizes it to heat water. This means that this device can also supply totally free hot water for domestic usage in addition to its conventional geothermal heating and cooling purpose.<p>
