<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure fact that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is just as essential as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will frequently build up in ductwork, restricting airflow. Considering that ductwork is so complicated, duct cleaning and duct maintenance can appear really daunting at first, requiring specialized tools, equipment, and know-how. When you go with Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you will not need to worry about a thing.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning system are more energy effective than models made even 5 years earlier, so it makes financial sense to replace or upgrade your unit if it's 5 years old or older.
