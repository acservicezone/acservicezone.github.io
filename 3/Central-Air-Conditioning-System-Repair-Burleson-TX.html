<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a referral later on). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very helpful in collecting information on the phone and providing clear directions about how to temporarily manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
