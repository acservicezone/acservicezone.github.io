<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should watch out for. First, you must check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
