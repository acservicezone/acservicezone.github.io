Pressed wood products made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiber board includes a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is usually recognized as being the greatest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood item.<p>
