<p>When trying to figure out how typically I need to change my air conditioning filters, there are lots of things to take into factor to consider. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has a special DNA on how it builds up dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how often your a/c filter gathers dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better right decision on how frequently your HVAC filters need replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less typically you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 homes with only one air conditioning filter require replacing more frequently.<p>

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
