<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate fantastic however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely useful in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to momentarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
<p>To start, it's a great concept to consider energy efficiency. By selecting a central AC system that has as high of a performance ranking as possible, you can decrease your carbon footprint and save cash in the long run. Efficiency ratings should be labeled with all units. While efficient units may cost more, choosing an Energy Star-rated device is a terrific method to take pleasure in additional peace of mind.<p>

Nevertheless, presuming they are set up correctly and correctly looked after, the likelihood of them having problems is small.<p>
