<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Finally, if you do recognize an especially energy-efficient in-floor heating unit and select to install it in your home, you might be eligible for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor costs. (And these costs can be substantial. According to figures gathered by Angie's List, homeowners can anticipate to pay between $6 and $16 per square foot, not including tax and labor, for a radiant heat system.)

<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by animals and people; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
