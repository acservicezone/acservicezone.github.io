<h3>Frequent Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Arkoma OK</h3>
<p>Dunes Heating And Cooling is HVAC Contractor offering the best possible Heating and Air Conditioning Repair, maintenance and installation for your home or organisation in Mount Pleasant, Charleston and Island of Palms South Carolina. You can depend on us to provide you with a system and solution that fits your special requirements and since we have actually installed lots of systems in this location, we have actually earned a reputation for getting the job done right the first time.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
