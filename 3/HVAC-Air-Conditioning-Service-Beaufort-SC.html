<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a routine oil change in your vehicle. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. During high usage months, check the filters at least monthly.<p>
