Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
