<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to reduce the amount of energy needed for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, actions must also be required to reduce contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for advised actions.) In addition, residents ought to be alert to the emergence of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization procedures must not be undertaken up until these issues have been remedied.<p>
<p>The contaminants noted in this guide have actually been revealed to cause the health effects mentioned. Nevertheless, it is not necessarily true that the effects noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels generally discovered in the house. In most cases, our understanding of the contaminants and their health effects is too restricted to determine the levels at which the listed results might occur.<p>
<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same. When the wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively solidify and treat-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
