<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or laboratory environments, as opposed to industrial or outside settings.

<p>A split air conditioning system includes 2 main parts - a compressor situated outside and a within air outlet unit. Unlike a system that needs a series of ductwork networked throughout the ceiling, split air conditioners rely on a set of pipes to link the outdoor to the within air unit which is why there are referred to as a ductless mini-split air conditioner installation Refrigerant is dispersed through the copper pipelines that cycle through the system to create either heated or cold air.<p>
