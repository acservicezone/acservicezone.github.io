<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run since it has to run longer than a properly sized system. Since it simply takes more electricity to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has a possibility to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
