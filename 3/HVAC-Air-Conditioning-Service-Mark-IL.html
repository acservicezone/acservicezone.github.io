<p>Geographically, some areas pay consistently greater earnings for air conditioning tradesmen. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable environment, or just a high level of competition for experienced trades.

The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 annually.

<p>There is no simple response, but lots of use the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a better service. If the existing system has not incurred other significant repairs, is in otherwise outstanding condition, and problems that led to the breakdown can be determined and treated, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense as well.<p>

This can result in the potential for considerable health problems.<p>
