<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
