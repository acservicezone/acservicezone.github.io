Due to these reasons, the job development for this occupation is higher than average.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that an a/c moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both need to be kept tidy. This indicates that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
