<p>Although installation is easy and does not need much time, trying this job is not a great idea. Unless you have training and knowledge of HVAC systems, taking on the installation could cause damage or installation errors that cause higher utility costs and poor system efficiency. Additionally, HVAC systems have guarantees that need certified service technicians to carry out installation. You could void the service warranties by handling that job.<p>
<p>Oftentimes, if materials have failed to dry numerous days after the believed water event, mold development is suspected within wall cavities even if it is not immediately visible. Through a mold examination, which may include damaging examination, one should be able to identify the existence or lack of mold. In a scenario where there shows up mold and the indoor air quality may have been jeopardized, mold removal might be needed. Mold testing and inspections need to be carried out by an independent private investigator to avoid any dispute of interest and to insure precise results; free mold screening offered by remediation companies is not suggested.<p>
<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company.

You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and ought to not "require" to offer you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I give you the options for your requirements and you choose if you require it.<p>
