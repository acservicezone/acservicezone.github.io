<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Similar to most home improvement projects, the cost of a full central heating system can differ commonly based upon the size of the house. Most furnaces will last between 15 and 20 years. In selecting a furnace, property owners need to think about heat output and efficiency. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace ought to be matched to the size of the house. A small home, for example, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too rapidly and turn off for too long, resulting in irregular temperature levels.<p>

In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.
