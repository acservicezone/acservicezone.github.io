<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which may get in nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside water fountains in public tourist attractions.
