As a society, we make certain that our houses are well-sealed and well-insulated, however we do not believe sufficient about exposure to all the things we position in our homes," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.

<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
