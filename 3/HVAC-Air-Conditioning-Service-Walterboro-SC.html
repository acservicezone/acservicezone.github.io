<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, given that some of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>
