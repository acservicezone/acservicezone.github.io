<h3>Air Condition System in Clayton CA</h3>
<p>Central air units are determined in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Often, indoor air quality problems in large commercial structures can not be successfully determined or treated without an extensive building investigation. These investigations may start with written surveys and telephone assessments in which structure private investigators evaluate the history of occupant signs and building operation procedures. In some cases, these questions might rapidly uncover the problem and on-site visits are unnecessary.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
