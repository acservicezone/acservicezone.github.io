<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs between $300 to $500 usually. It's the ductwork that provides cold air to each room in your home, and if it develops fractures which leakage, they require to be repaired. Having malfunctioning ductwork makes your system work harder with worse outcomes. Your house will not be sufficiently cooled, and your energy costs will go up. Installing new ductwork for the entire home will cost an average of in between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>

<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung out fixing the problem, all the while discussing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
