<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
