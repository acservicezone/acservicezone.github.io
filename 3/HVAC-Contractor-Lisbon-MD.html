<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning an organisation was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to develop business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners must strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
