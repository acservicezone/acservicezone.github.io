<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
