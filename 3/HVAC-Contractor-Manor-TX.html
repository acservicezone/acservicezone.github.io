A few high-end brand names have a performance of 95% by using a condenser. These are more pricey, having starting expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Because a drain needs to be installed, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ might see moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.
