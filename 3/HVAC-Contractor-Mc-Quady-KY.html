<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay.

Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it required to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't completion goal.
