<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the performance and performance of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor wisely, a number of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable score are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
