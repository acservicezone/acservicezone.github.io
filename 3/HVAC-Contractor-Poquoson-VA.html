<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for house owners to consider. Many times, these units include not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those looking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, given that the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are generally only available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best alternative for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
