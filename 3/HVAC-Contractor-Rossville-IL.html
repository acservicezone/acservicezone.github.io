<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance in Rossville IL</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or changing air in any space to offer high indoor air quality which involves temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates unpleasant smells and extreme moisture, presents outside air, keeps interior structure air circulating, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
