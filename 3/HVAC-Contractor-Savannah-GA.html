<p>Indoor air contamination originates from a range of sources; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has actually recognized building products, furnishings, and mold as serious concerns, but much of the threat also originates from burning things. For example, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop contamination in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially big issue in the developing world.<p>
<p>Volatile natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals discharged as gases from items or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
