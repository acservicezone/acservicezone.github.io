<p>Co2 (CO2) is a fairly easy to determine surrogate for indoor contaminants discharged by human beings, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are uncommonly high indoors might trigger residents to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are normally 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of co2 in many structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
