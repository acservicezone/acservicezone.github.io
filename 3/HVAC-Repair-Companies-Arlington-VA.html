Such a tool should identify the number of people impacted; specify ages and task descriptions of involved employees; identify where they lie within the office; indicate when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and season); offer a list of specific health signs or illnesses; identify all devices run in the office; show the type of outdoors air contamination; and identify potential sources of task tension.<p>
<p>We take a look at clues prior to we offer suggestions to change rather than repair a heater. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are higher every year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It might be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
