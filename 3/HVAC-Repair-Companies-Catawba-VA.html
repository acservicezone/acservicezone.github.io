For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide must be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be necessary.<p>
