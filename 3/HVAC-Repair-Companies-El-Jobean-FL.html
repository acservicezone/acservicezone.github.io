<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the right temperature. Heating systems that kick on frequently might be because of a dirty filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>
