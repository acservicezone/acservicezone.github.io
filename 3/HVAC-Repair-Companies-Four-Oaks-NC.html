<h3>Central Air Conditioning Service in Four Oaks North Carolina</h3>
<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>In an area where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good main heating systems. You'll want to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing. Your heating technician can set up controls which automatically shut down the heatpump if temperature levels reach and drop below freezing. The controls will require the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the house in these conditions.<p>
<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and detach block. Turn on the circuit breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to start (see Be Patient at Start-up," listed below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan must spin.
