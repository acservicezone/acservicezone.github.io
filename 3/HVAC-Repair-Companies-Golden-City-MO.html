<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The objective is to supply sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this. A typical aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air).
