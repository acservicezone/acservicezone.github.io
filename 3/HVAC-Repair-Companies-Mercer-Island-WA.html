<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)

He included these substantial but small changes in his bid. We decided to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump because of recent warmer summers and for ecological factors.<p>
