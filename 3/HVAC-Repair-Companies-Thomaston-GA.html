<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outside capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, because the overall capability of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outside unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that some of the rooms may not have a really comfy temperature level.

Poorly located outdoor air consumption vents can likewise bring in air contaminated with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading out biological contaminants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>
