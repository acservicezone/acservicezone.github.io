<p>Remember that the SEER rating is calculated utilizing the very same set of temperature levels across the board. The typical summer temperature level to come to the SEER ranking is 83 degrees, so to reach the proper SEER ranking for your location, subtract 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER rating needs to be at least 13 for all brand-new cooling systems produced in the United States.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
