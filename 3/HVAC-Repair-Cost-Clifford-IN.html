<h3>The Benefits of Buying A New Furnace in Clifford IN</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We decided on getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is among our greatest energy costs. We feel that this new unit will last a very long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
