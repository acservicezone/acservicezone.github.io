<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Egg Harbor City NJ</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment.

The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
