<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads.

Break outs in medical centers and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
