<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water.

The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite significant.<p>
