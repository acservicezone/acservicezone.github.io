<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
