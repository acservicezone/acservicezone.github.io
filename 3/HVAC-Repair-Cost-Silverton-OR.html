<p>Acknowledged as a leader in the HVAC market, Bard Manufacturing integrates quality items and outstanding service with development and technological advances to provide high-performance heating and cooling products around the globe. A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and allows cooling or heating of a number of spaces with one external unit. In the outdoor unit of this ac system there is a more effective compressor, ports for linking a number of traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor systems found in the room.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless system has an integrated efficiency advantage due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leakages in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions because they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Because a system is installed in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you exist.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
