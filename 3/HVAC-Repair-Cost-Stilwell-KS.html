<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in every month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There should not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
