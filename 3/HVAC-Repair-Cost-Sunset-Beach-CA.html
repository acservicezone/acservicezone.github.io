The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank need to be checked for leaks, the system must be flushed periodically to eliminate tank and collected pollutants (scaling in difficult water locations). The systems should be examined at least two times per year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensors.
