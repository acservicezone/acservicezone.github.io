<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well.
