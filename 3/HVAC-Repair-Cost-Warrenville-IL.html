<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
