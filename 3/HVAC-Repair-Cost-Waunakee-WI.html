<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your air conditioning system is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Just including refrigerant is not a solution if it leakages. A qualified technician should repair any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the appropriate amount of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the efficiency and efficiency of your air conditioner is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the manufacturer's requirements, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can likewise be damaging to the environment.<p>
<p>The first ac system and fridges utilized harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
