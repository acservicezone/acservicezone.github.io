<p>In houses, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are likely to be pressed wood products made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood items made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); wood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops).

It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older unit.<p>

If the present system has actually not incurred other major repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and problems that resulted in the breakdown can be identified and treated, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense also.<p>
