<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent additional damage to your system.<p>
<p>The main factor property owners do not buy an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the quantity of services used. If the system is brand-new and still under a manufacturer's guarantee, the cost may not be rewarding. Any major repairs must be covered under the maker's service warranty. However, some producers need routine maintenance as a regard to the warranty.<p>

Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
