<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
