<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can afford, so many Seattleites must find ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are taken up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring display screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to face the reality of a terrible, vicious summertime.<p>
<p>Almost half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least as soon as a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that frequently, our nationally representative survey discovered.

And practically 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
