At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
<p>It may simply need to be cleaned if your central air conditioner will not cool however you can hear it running. Whether this is the reason for the problem, it's a good early remedy to attempt.
