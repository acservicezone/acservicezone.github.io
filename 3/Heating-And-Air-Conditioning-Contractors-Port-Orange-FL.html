<p>We take a look at hints before we supply recommendations to change instead of repair a heating system. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater every year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be wasting cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
