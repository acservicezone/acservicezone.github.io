What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
