<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even small window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be changed or washed as conditions call for.

Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation.

Always make sure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in usage.<p>
