Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating units-- although ceiling radiators are usually utilized in commercial applications like storage facilities.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable greater airflow from the outdoors, air quality tracking platforms and sensors, and new air purification technologies are becoming more typical as available options in residential and commercial HVAC item packages.
