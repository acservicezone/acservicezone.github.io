<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that might affect the health of people who reside in the house. Pollutants could originate from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, yard trash burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground listed below. An air toxin could likewise originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unpredictable natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or moist carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care products. Infections and bacteria, animal dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, but lots of use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is probably a better solution. If the current system has not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and problems that resulted in the breakdown can be identified and fixed, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
