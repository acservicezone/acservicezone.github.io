<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in.

Outdoor PM, created by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
