<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from poorly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which might go into close-by ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and assisted living home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
