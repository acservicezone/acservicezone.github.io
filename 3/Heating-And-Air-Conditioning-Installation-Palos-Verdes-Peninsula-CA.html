<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Image 6).<p>
