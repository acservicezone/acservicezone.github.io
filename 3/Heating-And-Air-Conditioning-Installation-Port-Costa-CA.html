<p>At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to minimize levels of radon and its decay products. Due to the fact that they only partially eliminate the radon decay items and do not decrease the amount of radon going into the house, the efficiency of these gadgets is unpredictable. EPA plans to do additional research study on whether air cleaners are, or might become, a trusted means of decreasing the health risk from radon. EPA's booklet, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, offers additional information on air-cleaning gadgets to minimize indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. Once the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly cure and harden-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
