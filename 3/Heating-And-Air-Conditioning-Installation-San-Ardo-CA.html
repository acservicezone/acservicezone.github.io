<p>The function of many building ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for occupant convenience while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building security at sensible energy costs. Load calculating is described as the Handbook J computation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or system cost for cooling. If your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning unit you need based upon experience or on square video footage alone, relocate to another contractor. As with determining the size of a system needed based on BTUs, identifying the proper size of unit for your home also depends on the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
