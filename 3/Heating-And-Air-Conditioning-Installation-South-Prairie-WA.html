<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning a service was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it took to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC company owner must strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the exact same in all other locations.<p>
