<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family houses, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to big industrial and office buildings such as skyscrapers and medical facilities, lorries such as cars and trucks, trains, ships, airplanes and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are regulated with respect to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Air pollutants can range from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to unsafe gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a typical air contaminant resulting from gas that leaves into your home without being burned off.

The results of CO exposure can differ significantly from person to person depending on age, total health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
