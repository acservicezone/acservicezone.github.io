<p>A customized ac system that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning system because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the very same air course. A standard air conditioning system transfers heat out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of.
