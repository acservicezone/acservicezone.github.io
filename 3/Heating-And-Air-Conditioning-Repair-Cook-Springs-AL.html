<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roofing system, is most commonly utilized on commercial buildings, however it is likewise a choice for homeowners to consider. Often times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself however likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost.
