<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, see Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
