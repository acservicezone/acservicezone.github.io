<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<h3>Choosing the Right Company For Heating and AC Systems at Ecorse MI</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not use them.  Second of all like prolonged auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the unit has actually been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
