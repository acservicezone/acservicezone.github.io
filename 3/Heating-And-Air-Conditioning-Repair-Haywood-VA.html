<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
<p>Radiant heating provides a variety of special benefits over forced air heating systems. For instance, radiant heat systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems. They do not have to stress over duct leakages, which are responsible for output losses of as much as 30% in other heater types. Transferring heat through strong objects will also trigger it to last longer than utilizing air as a thermal medium. A home warmed by a radiant system will warm up quicker, and stay warm with less energy invested. These are just a few of the many benefits that a radiant heat system can use you.<p>
