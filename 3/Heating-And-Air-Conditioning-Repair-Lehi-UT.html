<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really practical in collecting information on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to temporarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
