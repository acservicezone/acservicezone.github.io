<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based just on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few affordable ones received. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up group was respectful of my house and set up the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up evaluation outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality.

<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Because it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off prior to it has a possibility to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
