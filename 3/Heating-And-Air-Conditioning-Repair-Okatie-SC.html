Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
