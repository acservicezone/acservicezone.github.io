<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate great however Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company utilized 98% of the existing product bought with your house.
