<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in every month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. When the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly harden and treat-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
