Replacing one indicates dismantling most of the furnace, replacing the part, and reassembling the furnace.

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Given that heating and cooling work might also require repairing or installing pipes to supply oil or gas to heating equipment, an HVAC contractor may also be required to hold a different plumbing technician's license or have a licensed plumbing professional on call. Nevertheless, some jurisdictions license HVAC contractors particularly for this type of work. When getting an estimate, be sure to ask not just if a company is accredited, but also what kind of license it holds.<p>
