<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside workplaces, schools, and other work environments is essential not only for workers' convenience but also for their health. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has been tied to signs like headaches, tiredness, difficulty concentrating, and inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.
