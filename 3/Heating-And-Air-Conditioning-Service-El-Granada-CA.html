<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>For whole house installations, it's difficult, if almost impossible, to retrofit a radiant heat system in an existing home, specifically a hydronic system. Localized glowing flooring heat systems to be used in one or a number of rooms like bathrooms, cooking areas or laundry rooms are quickly refurbished with electric radiant floor heat.

<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
