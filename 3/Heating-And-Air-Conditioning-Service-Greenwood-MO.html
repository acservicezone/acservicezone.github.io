<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not offer them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate.
