<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
