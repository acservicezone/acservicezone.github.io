<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Oxford GA</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really delighted that somebody as skilled as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to test the air conditioner prior to you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to test AC units even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>
