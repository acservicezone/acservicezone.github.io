<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in vehicles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC technicians. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by lots of individuals.<p>

<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, a lot of Midtown Houston Tx consumers don't understand why their HVAC system is not working.
