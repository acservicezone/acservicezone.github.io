<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the job based just on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few reasonable ones got. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install team was respectful of my home and set up the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post set up inspection outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality.

Never ever utilize a gas range to heat your house. When the fireplace is in usage, always make particular the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
