<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioner back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging product to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place 2 2x4s beneath the box to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level.

All things in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the convected heat system has actually been running for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

Improving those components may increase the effectiveness of the system as much or more than setting up brand-new equipment.<p>
