<p>Certain instant results resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is often challenging to determine if the symptoms are a result of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is important to focus on the time and place symptoms occur. If the symptoms fade or go away when a person is far from the area, for example, an effort needs to be made to recognize indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some impacts might be made worse by an inadequate supply of outside air coming inside your home or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions prevalent inside your home.<p>
