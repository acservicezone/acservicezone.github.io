<p>Most people understand that outdoor air pollution can affect their health, however indoor air contamination can also have significant, damaging result. EPA research studies of human exposure to air pollutants suggest that indoor levels of toxins may be 2 to five times-- and sometimes more than 100 times-- higher than outside levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board consistently rank indoor air contamination among the leading 5 ecological health dangers to the public.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging long trenches or deep holes to install the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. Nevertheless, you'll conserve cash over the long term because of the lower energy expenses. Likewise, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as traditional air-source units.

They're considerably more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
