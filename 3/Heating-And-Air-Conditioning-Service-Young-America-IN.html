<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the average house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather.

The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather substantial.<p>
