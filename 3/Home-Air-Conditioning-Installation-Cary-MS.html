Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source.

The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
