<h3>Furnace Installation in Elkhart Indiana</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a quick web search validated WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working.
