<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
