<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
