<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as near your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Choosing the ideal size air conditioner is an essential part of the HVAC purchasing procedure and one that you'll require an HVAC professional to assist you with. Here's why purchasing the right size a/c unit matters: if you buy an HVAC system that's too big, you'll wind up losing money and energy. And if it's too small, you won't get warm or enough cool air to keep you comfortable.<p>
