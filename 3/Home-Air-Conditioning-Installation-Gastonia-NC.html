Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to provide sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to achieve this.
