<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, occasionally linked to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the method is described as radiant heat.<p>

<p>A hydronic glowing flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes installed under the flooring or right within the floor surface itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the floor mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and individuals. It does not count on heating or moving air to move heat.<p>
