<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not put the condenser under a deck or totally confine it since it tires warm air out the top. Any air flow limitation will reduce the unit's efficiency. You can, nevertheless, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Speed System due to the fact that of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER.

Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
