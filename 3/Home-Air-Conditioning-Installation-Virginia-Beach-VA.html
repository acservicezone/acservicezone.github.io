<p>The first ac system and refrigerators utilized harmful or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a regular oil modification in your automobile. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter better traps contaminants and particles in the air. As soon as every 3 months, Energy Star advises replacing your filter. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
