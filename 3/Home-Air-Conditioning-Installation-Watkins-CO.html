<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and thus needs conditions appropriate for both organisms. The germs forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, including chlorine.

<p>A packaged system, normally installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is also an option for homeowners to consider. Many times, these systems include not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, because the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are typically only available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best option for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
