<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>While contaminants typically discovered in indoor air are responsible for lots of damaging impacts, there is substantial uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are necessary to produce particular health issue. People also react extremely in a different way to direct exposure to indoor air toxins. Further research is needed to much better understand which health effects take place after exposure to the average contaminant concentrations found in homes and which occur from the higher concentrations that take place for short amount of times.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the industry's growth doesn't necessarily translate to the experience of operating an HVAC company. The ventilation, heating and air conditioning business tends to run hot and cold.
