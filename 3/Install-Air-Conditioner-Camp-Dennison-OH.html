Needless to state, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the more difficult it is for your lungs to remove them.

These factors include bad ventilation (lack of outside air), problems controlling temperature, high or low humidity, current renovation, and other activities in or near a building that can impact the fresh air coming into the building. In some cases, specific pollutants like dust from construction or remodelling, mold, cleaning products, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (consisting of percentages of chemicals launched as a gas in time) might cause bad IAQ.<p>
