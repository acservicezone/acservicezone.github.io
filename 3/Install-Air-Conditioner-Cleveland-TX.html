I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion.
