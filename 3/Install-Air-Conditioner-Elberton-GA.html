<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced.

<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was really practical in collecting details on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to briefly handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.

<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, ceiling, wall, and floor coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to two days might become a source for mold growth and should be discarded. Sometimes there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in hidden or rarely accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, chances are there will be mold growing close by. Fix the wetness issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the location utilizing recognized health department suggestions.<p>
