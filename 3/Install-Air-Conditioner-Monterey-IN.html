<p>Central air systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.
