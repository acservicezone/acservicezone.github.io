<p>Self-installation tends to create more issues than it resolves. In truth, it frequently triggers professional intervention anyway to fix some of the problems that were produced throughout the installation.

<p>Energy effectiveness can be enhanced even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating unit. Zones are managed by multiple thermostats.

<p>Property owners might also presume that because a glowing flooring heating system can be seen (and funded) as a house improvement, its installation will instantly raise their home's worth.

That stated, homebuyers wanting to go green," who prioritize energy cost savings, or who definitely want an in-floor heating unit will be willing to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>
