<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Wagener SC</h3>
<p>From rewiring old knob-and-tube systems to dealing with furnace and AC setups, the Seattle electrical contractors and plumbers at Seatown have you covered.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
