If you have actually installed the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

The 2 operations utilize various procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to accomplish its goals.<p>
