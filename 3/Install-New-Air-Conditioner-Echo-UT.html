<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on.

<p>The compressor can overheat and shut down if the condenser coils are clogged. You'll experience intermittent durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling.

Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
