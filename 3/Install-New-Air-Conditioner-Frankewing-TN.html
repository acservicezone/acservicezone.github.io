Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

If a source of water or condensation can be found, chances exist will be mold growing nearby. Repair the moisture issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely clean the area utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>
