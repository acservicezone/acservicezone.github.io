Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of structure materials, cigarette smoking, family items, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of functions in made items. For example, it is used to include permanent-press qualities to clothes and drapes, as a component of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finish products.<p>
<p>Air conditioning unit makers generally make rugged, high quality items. Start by checking any merges or circuit breakers if your air conditioner fails.
