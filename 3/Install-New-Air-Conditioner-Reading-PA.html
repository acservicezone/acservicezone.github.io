<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most budget friendly if your home or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to install a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely useful in collecting details on the phone and providing clear directions about how to momentarily cope with the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
<p>Integrity Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heating systems were not working. They showed up the next day and replaced two heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the new furnaces can heat your house. Honestly, our home heating system is complicated, Rob and his group repaired the old duct work, altered all the dampers, make the entire system work completely.<p>
