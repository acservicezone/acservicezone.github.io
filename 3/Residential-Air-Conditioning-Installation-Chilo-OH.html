<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, however it is likewise an option for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these units include not only the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those seeking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, considering that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically just readily available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best choice for house owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
