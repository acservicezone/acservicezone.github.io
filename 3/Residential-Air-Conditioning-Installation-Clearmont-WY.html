<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Clearmont WY</h3>

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
