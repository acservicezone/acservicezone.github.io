<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do decline them until they have been correctly dried. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent gos to, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release contaminants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
