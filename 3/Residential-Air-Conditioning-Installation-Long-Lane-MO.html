<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered by a Long Lane MO HVAC Company</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run.

That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has a possibility to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
