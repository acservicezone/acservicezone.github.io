<h3>Working of a HVAC System at Nashotah WI</h3>
<p>The icing issue ends up being much more serious with lower outside temperature levels, so heatpump are commonly installed in tandem with a more traditional type of heating, such as an electrical heater, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heatpump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is utilized effectively during the milder temperature levels, and the system is switched to the standard heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
