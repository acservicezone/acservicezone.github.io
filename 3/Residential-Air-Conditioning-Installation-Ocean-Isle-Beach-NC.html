<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to offer auto debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There need to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
