<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
