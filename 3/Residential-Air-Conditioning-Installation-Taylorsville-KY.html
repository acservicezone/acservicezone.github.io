<p>Indoor environments are extremely complex and structure occupants may be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the form of particles and gases) from office makers, cleaning items, construction activities, furnishings and carpets, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building products, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outside contaminants. Other elements such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, but it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level.
