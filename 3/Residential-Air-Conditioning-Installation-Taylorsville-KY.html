<p>Indoor environments are extremely complex and structure occupants may be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the form of particles and gases) from office makers, cleaning items, construction activities, furnishings and carpets, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building products, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outside contaminants.

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, but it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level.
