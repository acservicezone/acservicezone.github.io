<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you need to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
