<p>Your Review This is my third time using Around the Clock. Ilan constantly makes himself available - whether it's a heating concern in the middle of the night in the depth of winter to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is knowledgeable with these gadgets). I have nothing but terrific things to state - he has taken good care of my heating and AC needs. Quick reaction - quick resolution.<p>
<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have concerns, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
