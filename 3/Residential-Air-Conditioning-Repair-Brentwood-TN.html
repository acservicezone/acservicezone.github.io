<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
