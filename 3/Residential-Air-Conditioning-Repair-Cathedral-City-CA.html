Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, throughout brand-new building and construction (homes generally use in between one and 5 lots). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot.

<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Cathedral City CA</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
