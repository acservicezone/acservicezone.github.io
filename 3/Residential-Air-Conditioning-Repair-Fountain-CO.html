<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas.

When radon becomes caught in buildings and concentrations build up inside, exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>

<h3>Efficient Heating and Air Conditioning Requires Proper Duct Sealing in Fountain CO</h3>
<p>Prices for furnace service and maintenance will differ widely from dealership to dealership, for a number of factors. Some dealers will be offer a more thorough service with stated efficiency guarantees, while others may do a more fundamental service at an unique rate to generate new service. Both approaches can yield the wanted result of keeping your furnace heating unit performing well as long as the service is offered by a reputable HVAC contractor.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
