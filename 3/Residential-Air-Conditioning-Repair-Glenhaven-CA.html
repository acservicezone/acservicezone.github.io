The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects contaminants from indoor air (revealed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (revealed in cubic feet per minute).

<p>As noted, incorrect temperature level and humidity levels, and too little or too much air blood circulation might also contribute to worker health grievances. Temperature level levels must range from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts caused by excessive air circulation should be prevented.
