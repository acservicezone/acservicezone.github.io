<p>Indoor air quality (likewise called "indoor ecological quality") explains how inside air can affect a person's ability, health, and convenience to work. It can consist of temperature, humidity, absence of outside air (poor ventilation), mold from water damage, or direct exposure to other chemicals. Currently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) requirements but it does offer guidelines about the most typical IAQ workplace grievances.<p>
<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
