<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for several years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel expenses all of a sudden appear higher than typical, it is probably time to think about a new system. New heating equipment is much more effective-- you'll see lower fuel bills right away, not to point out the cash you'll minimize repair expenses. You can probably expect to cut your fuel expenses in half if your heating system is 25 years old or more.<p>

<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Since these activities create big amounts of lead dust, people have been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint. Consult your state health or housing department for recommendations on which public companies or private laboratories may have the ability to help test your house for lead in paint. House test kits can not detect percentages of lead under some conditions. Hire an individual with special training for fixing lead paint problems to eliminate lead-based paint. Residents, especially children and pregnant ladies, need to leave the structure until all work is ended up and clean-up is done.<p>
<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait for the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Startup," listed below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan should spin. If the compressor starts but the fan doesn't, the fan motor is more than likely shot. Shut off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Picture 7). Reinstall the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the system and see if the fan starts. If  it does not, you've given it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
