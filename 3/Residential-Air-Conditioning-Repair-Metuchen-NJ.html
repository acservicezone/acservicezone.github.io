<p>If no impurity sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stagnant air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outside air. Stale air may also be an issue when ventilation is not adequate to account for a boost in the number of workers in the area.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
