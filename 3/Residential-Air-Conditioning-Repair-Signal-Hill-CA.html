This step is necessary so the system isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>
<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, because some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy.
