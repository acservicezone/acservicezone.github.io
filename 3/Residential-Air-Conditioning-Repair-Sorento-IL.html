<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can manage, a lot of Seattleites should discover methods to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC systems are taken up as soon as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle may be the last city in the country to face the reality of a cruel, cruel summer season.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have an unfavorable impact on occupants-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
