<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Amo IN</h3>
<p>When you and your family walk into your house in Sacramento, CA, are you as comfortable as you can be? Do you find it to be either too cold throughout the winter season or too warm in locations during the summertime? Whether you're having a problem with unequal cooling or heating, or your indoor air quality isn't up to par, Sierra Pacific House & Convenience, Inc. has the products and services you need.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
