<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the cost fantastic however Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>All cooling contractors must begin their examination of your home by performing an A/c Contractors of America Manual J load computation. This determines the heat gain your home is subject to.

If the one you're considering desires to figure out the right system for your house exclusively on experience, move on to another contractor. Though highly affected by where you live, a number of factors impact the size system required, including the amount of wall and attic insulation you have; the types and positioning of doors and windows; and the orientation of your home to the sun. The computation can also alert you to the possible benefits of upgrading the insulation in your house. By making your house more energy effective, you may be able to reduce the size of the air conditioning unit you require.<p>
