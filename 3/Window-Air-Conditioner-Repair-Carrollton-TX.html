<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my businesses, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who explained to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he advised me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is sincere, trusted, and sensible on rate. It's tough to find a sincere AC guy and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor wisely, a number of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed house owners.
