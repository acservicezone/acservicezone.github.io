<p>I usually do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
