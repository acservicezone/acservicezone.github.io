<p>As much of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant devices manufacturer's to ensure your factory warranties stay in location. Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is frequently hard to quantify, as one action mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented.
