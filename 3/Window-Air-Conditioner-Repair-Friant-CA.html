<p>Benzene is a known human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this chemical are ecological tobacco smoke, kept fuels and paint materials, and automobile emissions in connected garages. Actions that will decrease benzene exposure include getting rid of smoking cigarettes within the home, attending to maximum ventilation during painting, and discarding paint supplies and special fuels that will not be utilized immediately.<p>
<p>Furthermore, house owners have a range of choices to pick from in powering a floor heating unit. Radiant systems work with electrical, natural gas, solar and even geothermal energy sources. As many house owners are all too aware, tradition furnace systems are usually limited to operating on a single energy source, such as heating oil. If the market for that energy source turns unpredictable, rates can fluctuate, costs spike and you can wind up paying more to heat your home regardless of how low you set your thermostat.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
