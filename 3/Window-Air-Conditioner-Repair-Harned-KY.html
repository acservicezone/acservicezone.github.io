<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working properly. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
