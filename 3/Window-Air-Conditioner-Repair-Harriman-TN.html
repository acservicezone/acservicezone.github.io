<h3>Electric Furnace in Harriman Tennessee</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the see. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was really pleased they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will certainly be using them again.<p>
