<p>Pollutants such as cooking smells, animal dander, mold, cigarette smoke, and chemical doors might impact indoor air quality and harmful health effects may be produced that can threaten citizens. If members of your household are experiencing certain symptoms such as regular allergic reactions, other or cold breathing problems in your home, then it's time for these to be addressed and for your home's indoor air quality to be improved.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioner into a heatpump While space a/c supplies optimum versatility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is normally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
