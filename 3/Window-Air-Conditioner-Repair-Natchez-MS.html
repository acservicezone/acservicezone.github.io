<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can become blocked with particles that can limit airflow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's performance. Filthy filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, changing a furnace and inspecting filter can normally be carried out in simply a few minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
