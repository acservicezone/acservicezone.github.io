HVAC specialists advise following this fundamental rule when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
<p>I have actually used around the clock for 5 plus years now. I have signed a yearly maintenance agreement which covers two services every year. Ilan has been fantastic through all these years. Always keeps my system serviced and tuned. Haven't had any issues. Whenever he sees any issues, he notifies me about it and proactively repairs the parts. Very delighted with their service.
