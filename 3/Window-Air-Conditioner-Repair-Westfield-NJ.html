<p>Sean was really helpful. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
